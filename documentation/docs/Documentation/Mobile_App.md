# Mobile App


## Overview

Remnant was designed to connect users who love history to nearby historical locations. Sometimes you pass by a historically significant location and don't even know it. Our app is designed to let you know when you are near a sit that you might find interesting. 

### Screens

- **Nearby Activity**
 This screen is designed to show you locations near you. We take a users location and display a list of the closest historical sites in a selected radius. You can save locations or get directions through Google maps. Users can adjust their radius to allow for more or less nearby locations and also search for specific locations.
