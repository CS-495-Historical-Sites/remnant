Roosevelt hired Bill Sewall and Wilmot Dow, two Maine woodsmen, to run the ranch. Sewall and Dow built the ranch house, \"a long, low house of logs,\" in the winter of 1884\u20131885.\nThe Elkhorn Ranch was Theodore Roosevelt's \"main ranch\", and his preferred ranch house because it was larger and more private than his Maltese Cross Ranch cabin, established in 1883. Roosevelt particularly enjoyed sitting in the veranda in a rocking chair, reading in the shade of the cottonwood trees. His enjoyment is evident in his books, Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail, Hunting Trips of a Ranchman, and The Wilderness Hunter.\nIn the spring of 1886, thieves stole Roosevelt's boat from the Elkhorn Ranch. Sewall and Dow hastily built a raft and all three set off downriver to catch the thieves. When they did, Roosevelt kept watch over the three thieves with a shotgun and marched them overland to Dickinson, North Dakota, where he collected a $50 reward.\nRoosevelt quit the ranch in 1887 after losing 60% of his stock in the starvation winter of 1886\u201387, and returned only a handful of times to the badlands after that. He kept a small share of the cattle until 1898 at the outset of the Spanish\u2013American War.\nTheodore Roosevelt's writing desk from the Elkhorn Ranch is on display at Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The Elkhorn Ranch Site itself is protected as a unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n",

It is one of four extant churches in the area built by Pennsylvania German settlers in the nineteenth century. The church's design features a gable front entrance split into three sections, each with an arched doorway and large arched stained glass window; the central section is topped by a tall multi-faced steeple.The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 6, 1990.\n\n",

The lighthouse stands on the west side of the channel, in the river, its granite foundation built atop piles that have been driven into the riverbed, and is accessible only by boat.\nConstruction of the first lighthouse on the site began in 1838 when the land was ceded for $1.00 by the town of Esopus to the US government and the US government appropriated $6,000 to build the light.  The light became active in 1839.   It was a twin to the Rondout II lighthouse further north up the Hudson River. By 1867, however, the building was heavily damaged by flood and ice and funds for a new lighthouse were appropriated in 1870.\nThe current lighthouse was completed in 1871 and is the last wooden lighthouse in existence on the Hudson and the only Hudson lighthouse with a clapboard exterior. It was lit in 1872. One of a group of lighthouses in the Northeast built to an award-winning design by a Vermont architect, Albert Dow, Esopus Meadows Light has sister lights at Rose Island Light, Sabin Point, Pomham Rocks, and Colchester Reef.  Esopus Meadows Light was closed in 1965 and by the 1990s it had fallen into a state of disrepair. The most serious problem was the deterioration of the foundation, which had begun to fall apart due to ice damage.The Save Esopus Lighthouse Commission leased the lighthouse from the United States Coast Guard in 1990 for the purposes of restoration. They eventually took ownership in September 2002, as part of the pilot program for the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as Esopus Meadows Lighthouse.\nEsopus Meadows Light is shown on the NOAA Chart 12347.\n\n",

Of the 40 triple deckers in the district, 27 have gambrel roofs, and most of these have an asymmetrical facade with porches on the first two levels, and a recessed porch area in the gambrel section of the facade.  These porches are usually flanked on one side by a two-story projecting window bay.  Detailing on the porches varies: some, such as 8 Euclid, have Tuscan columns, while others, such as 8 Montrose, have squat square columns; columns are also sometimes paired or clustered in groups.  Houses with triangular gables more typically have three-story porches, often with arched openings instead of a simpler construction.  The layout of the properties on the hill, combined with the somewhat cohesive styling of the buildings, makes the district visually distinctive from its surroundings when viewed from a number of perspectives.  The district includes Deedy Park, a triangular grassy area where Euclid and Montrose meet.Most of the district was built out between 1910 and 1930.  The area was attractive to laborers as well as white collar workers, given easy access by streetcar on Vernon Street to the city's work centers.

Built in 1860 in the Italianate style, it is one of the most significant buildings in the neighborhood of East Walnut Hills.By 1860, Bernard Moormann had established himself as one of Cincinnati's leading dry goods merchants.  Choosing to build a new house in East Walnut Hills, he selected a two-and-a-half-story design built of brick.  Except for a small ell on the western side of the rear, it is a simple rectangle in shape.  Measuring five bays wide, the south-facing front of the house features such elements such as varied shapes of windows and an archway around the front door, plus ornamented lintels around the second-floor windows.  Surrounding the front entrance is a small porch with multiple columns, and sheltering the entire house is a large detailed cornice at the level of the attic.Both before and after Moormann's residence in the house, it experienced few changes: into the late twentieth century, it was one of the best remaining examples of nineteenth-century residential architecture remaining in Cincinnati's more suburban neighborhoods.  Because of its place as an example of leading local architecture, the Moormann House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\n",

The house is also the home of the Ulster County Historical Society and is currently open to the public as a museum.\nBevier House is believed to have been constructed around 1680 by Andries Pieterse Van Leuven. The original part of the house, currently the kitchen, was designed in the Dutch style and was probably a one-room, one-story structure. In 1715, the house was bought for 440 pounds from Pieter Andries Van Leuven by Louis Bevier, Jr., son of the New Paltz patentee, who expanded the structure and operated it as part of a large farm. The house was donated to the Historical Society in 1938 after being used by seven generations of the Bevier Family between 1715 and 1939, during which it was expanded to the two-story building currently standing.The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.The museum displays a series of additions and renovations that explain its history and provide context for the artifacts donated by the family and numerous others. The museum's collection includes farm implements, home furnishings and decor, and an array of American Civil War memorabilia relating directly to Ulster County. It also includes the earliest-known land grant map for Ulster County.\n\n",

It is believed that the first white settlers of the Greater Cincinnati area chose the Riverside Drive area for their settlement.  Riverside Drive was a popular place to build the finest houses in Covington, with many still standing from the early 19th century. Over thirty of the buildings in the district are considered exceptional samples of their architectural style.There are several independently notable buildings in the district. The Daniel Carter Beard Boyhood Home was the boyhood home of Daniel Carter Beard, founder of the Boy Scouts of America, and is a National Historic Landmark. The 1815-built Thomas Carneal House, the first brick house in Covington, is a Georgian-style domicile reminiscent of Italian architect Andrea Palladio; it still features a tunnel leading to the Licking River that allowed the owners to help slaves escape from their rightful owners as part of the Underground Railroad. Prominent visitors to the house included the Marquis de Lafayette, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and Daniel Webster.Seven bronze statues of prominent figures in the history of the area are placed in lifelike poses on riverside benches.

It was established in the 1850s with the construction of a small frame residence.  This building, the original farmhouse, was built just one story tall and composed of two rooms.  The builder was the farm's namesake, Hammand Hersh Roudebush.A native of Adams County in southeastern Pennsylvania, Roudebush and his parents settled in Ohio in 1834 when he was just four years old.  Twenty-five years later, he and his wife Emeline bought a Harrison-area property known as \"Sand Hill\" and settled there; this became the present Roudebush Farm.  After completing the original farmhouse and barn in the same year, the Roudebushes became prosperous enough to expand their buildings, and accordingly they expanded the house greatly in 1870.  No longer was the house simply a small frame structure: the addition is built of brick with many ornate Italianate details and multiple fine porches.  Among the most distinctive elements of the house is its elaborate formal parlor, which retains the furniture, silk wallpaper, and carpet with which it was furnished in 1875.In 1976, the Roudebush Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture.  Four contributing properties are included within the 9 acres (3.6 ha) of property designated as historic, including the farmhouse, the barn, and a schoolhouse, although the schoolhouse is no longer used for educational purposes.\n\n",

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.  It was the first burying ground of an area that now encompasses Revere as well as neighboring Chelsea and Winthrop.The land was originally owned by Samuel Cole.  In 1654 William Hasey purchased it; his descendants sold it to Joshua Cheever, Esq. in 1740. Cheever and the town of Chelsea (of which Revere was still part) agreed on March 7, 1743 that the land would be a burying place and he deeded it to the town on December 8, 1751.Prior to the establishment of this burying ground, people who lived in the area were buried in Boston's Copp's Hill Burying Ground.  After a smallpox epidemic swept the city in 1690, Boston officials ordered that its victims north of the Charles River be buried \"on that side of the Water\".  Some victims of this epidemic may have been the first burials at Rumney Marsh.  The first documented burial was that of Mary Smith, wife of John Smith, in 1693. The last burial was in 1929.The cemetery is notable for containing the graves of sixteen Black individuals, some free and some enslaved, whose burials are documented in part by an 1897 map of the site. Two plaques stand along the Northern wall of the cemetery providing the names, dates of death, and approximate ages of these individuals, as well as some of the names of their enslavers. Most are buried along the Northern wall. However, according to a 1938 book called \"The History of Revere\" by Benjamin Shurtleff, three \u2013 Job Worrow (a veteran of the Revolutionary War serving under Captain Samuel Sprague, who is also buried in the Rumney Marsh Burying Ground), Betty Worrow, and Fanny Fairweather \u2013 are buried in the Southeast corner. Although none of these individuals' graves are marked, Fanny Fairweather is reported by Shurtleff to have had a monument with the inscription \"Fanny Fairweather, died 1845, age 80, a native of Africa.\"Since many of the burials were in the 18th century, the cemetery is exemplary of funerary art during the colonial period. For example, many of the slate gravestones feature a skull and wings motif. Two gravestones have been specifically identified as the work of carver Joseph Lamson (1658\u20131722); that of Mary Cutler (died 1703), and that of John Winthrop's son Deane Winthrop (died 1703/4). Work by stone carvers Robert Fowle and Richard Adams can also be found among the graves.People buried in the cemetery include:\nDeane Winthrop, son of John Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  Deane Winthrop's House, also on the National Register, is nearby in Winthrop.\nPhillips Payson, the fighting pastor, hero of the Battle of Lexington\nSixteen enslaved and free Black people\nVeterans of the Colonial, Revolutionary, 1812, and Civil Wars.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n",

Originally built for William Ruth, a merchant and trustee of the first free school in Delaware, the house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1973.Ruth bought the property in 1807  and started his \"Mansion House\" soon thereafter. His house-builder used Owen Biddle's 1805 pattern book, The Young Carpenter's Assistant, for some of the designs, specifically the step end brackets of the main stair, which match the pattern book exactly (see photo). The house has been added to and renovated a number of times. The north section was added ca. 1841. The house contains 9 fireplaces, 6 in the original brick L-shaped section, including a large kitchen fireplace with original crane intact.The main section had a second floor bay window added during the Victorian period, and the main section was renovated in the 1910s, adding a new newel post and main front door in the entrance hall, as well as sliding double doors into the main parlor, and French doors between the main parlor and the new dining room in a new frame addition to the rear, and a new front porch. The new front door and newel post are very similar to designs published in the Sears catalogues in the 1910s. An open porch behind the 1920s kitchen was enclosed in the 1950s. There are a number of shed additions to the rear of varying dates.\nWilliam Ruth was a merchant who bought local produce and shipped it to Philadelphia from the port of Leipsic, Delaware, then known as Fast Landing, which was renamed Leipsic in 1814. He died in 1822, willing the property in two halves, splitting the house in half.\n\n",

        "long_description": "The Bartow\u2013Pell Mansion is a historic house museum at 895 Shore Road in the northern section of Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx in New York City. The two-story building, designed in the mid-19th century by an unknown architect, has a Greek Revival facade and federal interiors and is the last surviving manor house in the Pelham Bay Park area. The grounds surrounding the mansion take up 9 acres (3.6 ha) and include a three-story carriage house; terraced gardens overlooking Long Island Sound to the east; and a small burial plot for the Pell family, which once occupied the land.\nThe house sits on an estate that Thomas Pell purchased from the native Siwanoy in 1654; the Pell family built two previous residences on the grounds in both 1675 and 1790. Robert Bartow, a descendant of Thomas Pell, built the third and current house at some point between 1836 and 1842. Ownership of the house remained in the Bartow and Pell families until 1888, when the government of New York City bought it, and the house remained empty until 1914 when the International Garden Club, co-founded by Zelia Hoffman and Alice Martineau, leased it. The IGC renovated the home into a clubhouse and moved in during 1915. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia used the mansion as his summer residence during 1936. The IGC opened part of the house to the public as a museum in May 1946 while continuing to use it as a clubhouse. The mansion's carriage house was restored between 1987 and 1993.\nThe house is oriented on a north-south axis with wings on either side, and has a stone facade with balconies and large windows. The interior of the mansion's first floor is arranged around a square central hall with an elliptical staircase; it includes two parlors, a sitting room and a small dining room. The second floor contains bedrooms, while the cellar was used for storing wine. The carriage house, which contained a stable hand's home, vehicular storage, and the hayloft, has served as an exhibition and educational space since 1993. Some of the furnishings include the desk of Aaron Burr and a Lannuier bed. The mansion's facade, interior, and surrounding grounds are designated as a New York City designated landmark and a National Historic Landmark.\n\n",

It also served as the headquarters for the company from 1925 to the early 1960s, after which the headquarters moved to Murray Hill, New Jersey.\nThe site was also the home for part of the Manhattan Project during World War II.\nAfter two years of renovations by Richard Meier, the building was reopened in 1970 as Westbeth Artists Community for low- to middle-income artists. In addition to affordable artist housing, the complex contains a theatre, an art gallery, and a synagogue.\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975. The complex was listed a second time on the National Register in 2009, for its high-profile and successful example of adaptive reuse of the property.\nThe southern viaduct section of the West Side Line railroad passed underneath the building at first floor level. This segment remains in place but is now isolated from the rest of the former railroad viaduct, which is now the High Line elevated park. \n\n",

Established in 1876 in what was then called Indian Territory, the mission school considered moving to a more populated area in the 1890s.  After a 1901 fire that destroyed much of what was then called the \"Catholic University of Oklahoma\", the decision was made to move the high school and college to Shawnee, 35 miles (56 km) to the north. Viktor Klutho was hired to design the new facility. A specialist in Tudor revival architecture, Klutho designed a massive five-story brick building to combine church, school and abbey in a single edifice, opening to 40 boys in the fall term of 1915. This served until the 1940s when a new church was built nearby, and in the 1950s the abbey moved to a new campus adjoining the school. In the 1960s the school discontinued high school education and admitted women to the college.",

Other dimensions exist that suggest a smaller structure that stood approximately 6.8 feet (2.1 m) in height and 57 feet (17 m) in diameter east and west and 50 feet (15 m) north to south. The mound is located on a hilltop that overlooks the valley of a tributary creek that flows west into the Mill Creek, which correlates with Section 30 of the original Columbia Township, near the Montgomery turnpike (now U.S. Route 22), that is, near end of present-day Grand Vista Avenue.  The Norwood Mound lies approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to the southwest.During the late nineteenth century, local residents partially excavated the mound and the ground around it; their diggings revealed significant amounts of mica and divers types of stone tools, including axes, scrapers, chisels, and flint projectile points.  These findings, combined with the location of the mound itself, have led archaeologists to conclude that Benham Mound was built by people of the Hopewell tradition.  Because of its archaeological value, the Benham Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\n",

Distinguished by its little-modified late nineteenth-century architecture, it has been named a historic site.\nBuilt of brick covered with a slate roof, the Romanesque Revival building features elements of stone and terracotta.  Its facade is divided into five bays, each of which features a large arch, while the street-facing southern side is functionally a larger form of the facade.  The building was designed by Peters and Burns, a Dayton-based architectural company, and constructed under the direction of Dayton contractors Beaver and Butt.  During the building's early years, it was home to companies such as the Manhattan Clothing Store and Oleman's Department Store, which maintained premises there in the 1890s and 1910s respectively.  However, the building was not always used for commercial purposes; an arts school operated in the building during the 1888-1889 schoolyear.  Among the building's interior features is a mail chute, which according to local lore is one of the earliest installed in any building nationwide.Benjamin Kuhns, the building's namesake, moved from Lancaster, Pennsylvania to Dayton in 1855 at the age of thirty.  By his fiftieth birthday, Kuhns was a prominent industrialist, having taken a small Dayton firm and turned it into a prominent manufacturer of agricultural equipment.  He was also a prominent philanthropist, having been one of the primary founders of Miami Valley Hospital.The Benjamin Kuhns Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1978, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture.  By the early twenty-first century, the Kuhns Building had undergone a highly successful redevelopment process, but like the Kettering Tower and several other downtown buildings, it experienced foreclosure in 2010 after the corporation that owned it fell behind on the mortgage and on property taxes. In 2019, it was sold by the city of Dayton to a developer.\n\n",

There were later twentieth-century additions to the house, of a 1+1\u20442-story wing and connecting hyphen. The creek side has a long screened porch.The property is also significant for its associations with Richard Bennett, Puritan governor of the Virginia colony from 1652 to 1655, during the reign of Oliver Cromwell. He had a plantation in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, as well as other properties. Also involved in the colony of Maryland, in 1665 Bennett patented 2500 acres on the north side of Wicomico Creek. His grant was large enough to be classified under the Maryland system as a manor.The property was bought in 1721 by George Dashiell (1690\u20131748) from one of Bennett's grandchildren; he patented 1740 acres after a re-survey. A wealthy planter, Dashiell is believed to have built the house that currently stands on the property. He served in the Lower House of the Assembly in 1724, 1745, and 1746. He attained the rank of Colonel in the Maryland militia by 1736. His family retained the property until 1791.Bennett's Adventure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\n",

Near it is a flag pole and another memorial. At the north end of the green is the former town library built in 1903-1904.  Several historic buildings surround the green including, the current Congregational Church (built in 1941 and the fourth church on the site), the Grange Hall (1947), the Parsonage (1941), a 19th-century residence once used as a parsonage, and a school house (c. 1865, now used by the local historical society).The town of Prospect was settled in the 18th century and separately incorporated in 1827.  Its town center arose in 1778, when the site, the highest in town, was selected for construction of a church.  The town green was also laid out at that time, but remained in church ownership until 1905, when it was sold to the town.  In the 19th century it developed as the civic heart of the town, with a Greek Revival school house built in 1867, and its first dedicated town library building (now the Meeting Place) built in 1905 as a gift of the Tuttle family. The library now occupies modern premises south of the church.\n\n",

From its commanding heights, sentries could once monitor much of the northern shoreline of O\u02bbahu, and even spot signal fires from the Wailua Complex of Heiaus on Kaua\u02bbi, with which it had ties. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962, when it became the center of a 4-acre (16,000 m2) state park. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.Pu\u02bbu o Mahuka means \"Hill of Escape.\" Hawaiian legends have it that from this point, the volcano goddess Pele leaped from O\u02bbahu to the next island, Moloka\u02bbi.\nThe highest of the heiau's three walled enclosures may date to the 17th century, with the lower two enclosures perhaps added during the 18th century. These were times of great conflict, and the upper platform appears to have functioned as a luakini heiau (a sacrificial temple) to bring success in war. During the 1770s, the overseer of this heiau was Ka\u02bbopulupulu, the high priest of the last independent high chief of O\u02bbahu, Kah\u0101hana. In 1792, George Vancouver's ship, HMS Daedalus, anchored near Waimea Bay to collect water. Three men in his shore party were killed in a skirmish with Native Hawaiians, 1930's archeologist J. Gilbert McAllister noted it was \"probable\" that the bodies of the three men were then taken to the heiau as human sacrifices. After Kamehameha I conquered O\u02bbahu in 1795, his high priest Hewahewa led religious ceremonies here and the heiau remained in use until the traditional kapu system was abolished in 1819.At the start of Makahiki, the four months of Hawaiian New Year, an observer standing at Ka\u02bbena Point would see the Pleiades (Makali\u02bbi) rising out of Pu'u o Mahuka Heiau just after sunset.\nThe site can be reached from Pupukea Homestead Road (Highway 835), which starts at Kamehameha Highway (Highway 83) across from Pupukea fire station.\n\n",

Begun by Yellowstone park superintendent Philetus Norris, the bath house was intended to have two rooms and a dirt-covered roof, but was never completed. Begun in 1881, it may be the oldest extant park visitor structure in the National Park Service system.The ruins are located near the western end of Sentinel Meadows on a travertine mound formed by Queen's Laundry Spring. The structure measures 8.16 feet (2.49 m) by 19 feet (5.8 m), and had a low shed roof. The log walls were vee-notched. The roof structure is incomplete and gradually deteriorating, and was intended to be covered with earth.. The interior comprises two rooms of approximately equal size, which are in the process of gradually being covered by hot springs deposits.\nIn his 1881 annual report,  Superintendent Norris proposed the construction of the bath house for public use. After the structure was partly built, Superintendent Patrick H. Conger took over management and declined to pursue its completion. The park proposed removing it entirely in 1964, but opted to retain it as the only example of a park structure from Yellowstone's early period of civilian management.\n\n",

The trail was developed further in the 1920s, but was still considered to be in poor condition.  In the 1930s further improvements were made, and in 1934 workers from the Public Works Administration rebuilt the section between Lone Pine Lake and Lake Verna. In 1940 workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps improved three miles (4.8 km) of trail beyond Adam Falls, building causeway sections through swampy areas. The trail was rebuilt again in 1970, and was improved between 2000 and 2003 with stone steps and handrails at Adam Falls.The trail was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 28, 2005.",

It is of significance because of its association with William Penn who granted the site \"for a Meeting House and Burial Yard, Forever\" near the center of the 18,000-acre (73 km2) Nottingham Lots settlement and was at one time the largest Friends meeting house south of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Half-Yearly Meeting was held here as early as 1725.  During the Revolutionary War, an American Army hospital was established here in 1778 for sick and wounded troops under General William Smallwood's command and the Marquis de Lafayette's troops camped in the Meeting House woods on the first night of their march from the Head of Elk to victory at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.",

It was built in 1869-1870 and is typical of the Italian Villa mode of late 19th-century architecture.  It was dedicated in a large ceremony with speeches later published in a printed phamplet and attending crowds in early 1870. Old Eastern High is a two-story brick structure that features a square plan, three corner towers (northwest, southwest, southeast), and elaborate bracketing cornices, with a similar wood decorated porch/portico over front entrance on its west side facing Aisquith Street.\nEastern Female High School was founded (along with its twin sister secondary school Western High School) in 1844 and was one of the pioneer high schools in the country devoted to secondary education for women. It was designed by Baltimore architect Colonel R. Snowden Andrews (1830-1903), also a former officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.\nIn 1907, the girls high school moved to larger, better equipped quarters further northeast in the city at the southeast corner of Broadway and East North Avenue (the former Samuel Gompers Vocational High School building, 1938\u20131953), where it remained for another three decades until 1938, when it moved to East 33rd Street and Loch Raven Boulevard (Eastern High School (Baltimore)), until it closed in the late 1980s.  Then the old girls school building on Aisquith and Orleans was used as an elementary school through the early 1970s. Later in the 1970s the building was converted into apartments.The city transferred the building to Sojourner-Douglass College in 2003 after the institution paid $150,000. The college, which also operated in several other former buildings of the Baltimore City Public Schools, ceased operation in 2015. In August 2016 the City of Baltimore listed the building on a foreclosure auction and sold it in 2017. It was to be developed into an entertainment and arts center, but the building remains vacant as of 2019.Eastern Female High School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.",

Interiors are sheathed in polished planks and narrow wainscoting, rooms are lightened by large, half-round clerestory windows, and twig work decorates verandas and eves.

The average size of the lots was 5400 square feet, although there was some variance in size, and a one-acre plot was reserved for the Taft mansion (demolished c. 1952 and the land subdivided).  The houses are architecturally heterogeneous, reflecting all of the major styles of the period; some properties were designed by Norman Isham.The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 24, 2003, and was enlarged in 2014 to include the southern part of Stillhouse Cove Reservation, a municipal park.

It is an outstanding and important example of a Federal style plantation house, consisting of a 2\u00bd-story main structure over a full basement with a 2-story kitchen linked by a 1-story hyphen. The kitchen wing and hyphen are typical of late eighteenth century ancillary architecture in Southern Maryland. The walls are laid in Flemish bond, and the chimneys are typical of Maryland; wide on the side, thin and high above the ridge, rising on the gable ends of the house flush with the building wall. The interior exhibits outstanding Federal style trim, including elaborate Adamesque moldings and plasterwork ornamentation such as garlands, swags, and urns applied to interior doorways and mantles. A pyramidal roof, log meat house stands on the immediate grounds.\nThe architectural design and unique features of the house were documented in the permanent collection of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) at the Library of Congress in 1936 and again in 1983. This documentation notes: \"Pleasant Prospect reflects the wealth and elegance of the upper class of planters in Prince George's County during the late 18th and early 19th century. The house was unusually large and well appointed for its time, with a large hall or passage, formal parlor, separate dining room and a library in the main block of the first floor.\"Pleasant Prospect was built c. 1798 for Dr. Isaac Duckett, described as one of the most opulent slave owners in the state.  It is one of four houses built in Prince George's County during this period that were valued at $1,500 (~$33,908 in 2022) or more in the 1798 Federal Direct Tax assessment and is described in that document as \"a new Two story Brick dwelling, very elegantly furnished with passage 20 by 16, kitchen 19 by 14, all of Brick.\" Pleasant Prospect is one of three plantations built by the Duckett family in Prince George's County.  The other two are Fairview, built by Isaac Duckett's brother Baruch around 1800, and Melford in the 1840s.\nPleasant Prospect was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.",

It was designed by architects Lescher & Mahoney and built by Clinton Campbell.  It is an Exotic Revival/Moorish Revival style building.  The building and its 0.8-acre (0.32 ha) property were listed on the National Register of Historic Places for the building's architecture in 1989 as \"El Zaribah Shrine Auditorium\". It was also listed on the Phoenix Historic Property Register at that time.In 1988 the Shriners began construction of a new building and made plans to vacate the building at 15th and Washington, which was in an area where the state government was establishing a government mall.  In late 1989, the Shriners completed their new auditorium building at 552 N. 40th Street, which now bears the name \"El Zaribah Shrine Auditorium\".After the Shriners relocated, the state government of Arizona acquired their original building to house the museum and offices of the Arizona Department of Mines and Mineral Resources, which moved in in October 1991. The building was renamed the Polly Rosenbaum Building in honor of Polly Rosenbaum, a longtime member of the Arizona House of Representatives who, in collaboration with then-governor Rose Mofford, spearheaded efforts to obtain and renovate the building as a permanent home for the Department's mineral collection and archives. This is one of two Arizona state government buildings in Phoenix that are named for Rosenbaum; the other is the Polly Rosenbaum State Archives and History Building, located at 19th and Madison and completed in 2008.In February 2010, Governor Jan Brewer announced that the Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum would become the Arizona Centennial Museum for the state's 2012 centennial celebration. The building was to be transferred from the Arizona Dept of Mines and Mineral Resources to the Centennial Commission then subsequently to the Arizona Historical Society.  The mining museum was abruptly closed on May 1, 2011, but funding for the proposed museum did not materialize.  In 2012 the building was closed and empty.There were later plans in association with the University of Arizona for the building to be developed as an Arizona Mining, Mineral and Natural Resources Education Museum.",

Porter Farm was the site of the first cooperative farm demonstration, organized in 1903 by Dr. Seaman A. Knapp. The project successfully demonstrated methods to expand crop production. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Extension Service developed from this foundational project.\nThe property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Porter Farm had been selected by the community to participate in the project, with $1000 set aside to cover potential losses. Knapp worked with Walter Porter to set aside 70 acres (28 ha) of the farm, on which the experimental use of fertilizers on some plots and rotation with nitrogen-fixing legumes doubled normal yields of cotton. The success of this project led to the creation of government Extension Service programs, which went on to develop methods to combat boll weevil infestation in the area.The Porter Farm is located about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Terrell, on FM986.  The total farm property was historically about 500 acres (200 ha).  The property includes the Porter homestead, a 1-1/2 story Cape style frame house located on the southeast side of FM986, while the demonstration land is mainly on the northwest side.  Today a tomato barn, which is not historically significant, stands on that land.",

It was located on the bank of the Patuxent River in the city of Laurel, Prince George's County, Maryland.  It was constructed in 1844\u20131845 for Captain William Mason & Son of Baltimore. It was complemented by the neighboring Laurel Mill built in 1811, S.D. Heath's machine shop, and Richard Israel's flouring mill. At that time it was provided with the machinery for the manufacture of fine cloth, running as many as 1,500 cotton spindles with 150 employees. In 1845, industrialist Peter Gorman was responsible for the first macadamized (paved) road in Laurel, Avondale Street next to the new Mill.The mill was sold for $10,000 with a $13,000 ground rent in 1850 to S.P. Heath and James Arthur (Webb Heath & Co.). In the mid-1850s, it was converted to a gristmill. The waters of the Patuxent provided an 8\u20139 foot fall and gave the mill 60-70 horsepower to use, along with steam power fueled by coal from Cumberland as early as 1854. George William Brown purchased the 21.7 acre property and outbuildings from Benjamin F. Crabbs, but sold his holdings in a mortgage auction on 20 October 1897. By 1904, the mill employed only 4 people, but produced $10,400 in product annually. Avondale Mill was the only one of Laurel's 19th century mills to have survived into the late 20th century.  A devastating fire on December 19, 1991, destroyed the mill. The remains were then demolished and the site cleared for use as a community park.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.",

Circa 1815, he had a home built for himself, his wife, Margaret, and their children, a brick dwelling with a two-story, three-bay main block flanked by one-story, two-bay wings. A full-width front porch, added about 1894, was removed sometime after 1971 and replaced with a facsimile of the original porch.Mrs. Samuel (Emily) Kirkland, the last of four generations of Kirklands to occupy the house, lived there until 1985.\nThe property had gone through several owners prior to Kirkland's purchase of the property, the most well-known being William Few, Jr., whose father, William Few, Sr., had a house built on the property c. 1764.\nToday, Ayr Mount is a publicly accessible historic site located on 265 acres (1.07 km2). It is owned and operated by Classical American Homes Preservation Trust. The home has been furnished with Federal period antiques and decorative art, including some original Kirkland furnishings.

It is one of the finest remaining examples in Maryland of a Queen Anne style railroad station.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Garrett County, Maryland in 1974 as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station, Oakland. It was revived for service on Amtrak's Shenandoah between 1976 and 1981. The city of Oakland bought the station in 1998, and in 2000 restored it with help from the State of Maryland. The station is now the Oakland B&O Museum and is run by the Garrett County Historical Society.The Museum features the Baltimore & Ohio 476, a 2-8-0 Consolidation-type steam locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in December, 1920.  The engine started life with the Jonesboro, Lake City and Eastern Railroad as #40, and became #76 when that railroad was acquired by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (Frisco).  After performing freight service for years, the engine was sold in 1947 to the Mississippian Railway where it retained the Frisco number.  Following several further changes in ownership, the engine was acquired by the Oakland B&O Museum in 2018 where it was renumbered and relettered as the Baltimore & Ohio 476 as representative of a typical B&O locomotive. The B&O did run 2-8-0 steam engines as its Class E locomotives.  The tender mated with the locomotive was previously in operational service with the Arcade & Attica Railroad's Engine #18, and was acquired by the museum in 2018 in a swap.",

Most of the pueblo structures date to two eras, dating between 1150 and 1600 AD.\nThe monument is 50 square miles (130 km2) of the Pajarito Plateau, on the slopes of the Jemez volcanic field in the Jemez Mountains. Over 70% of the monument is wilderness, with over one mile of elevation change, from about 5,000 feet (1,500 m) along the Rio Grande to over 10,000 feet (3,000 m) at the peak of Cerro Grande on the rim of the Valles Caldera, providing for a wide range of life zones and wildlife habitats. 3 miles (5 km) of road and more than 70 miles (110 km) of hiking trails are built. The monument protects Ancestral Pueblo archeological sites, a diverse and scenic landscape, and the country's largest National Park Service Civilian Conservation Corps National Landmark District. Two-thirds of the park, 23,267 acres (9,416 ha), is designated as the Bandelier Wilderness Area. Motorized travel and permanent structures are forbidden in the Wilderness.\nBandelier was designated by President Woodrow Wilson as a national monument on February 11, 1916, and named for Adolph Bandelier, a Swiss-American anthropologist, who researched the cultures of the area and supported preservation of the sites.  The park infrastructure was developed in the 1930s by crews of the Civilian Conservation Corps and is a National Historic Landmark for its well-preserved architecture.

The museum was conceived as an institution focused on a broad public. The Brooklyn Museum's current building dates to 1897 and has been expanded several times since then. The museum initially struggled to maintain its building and collection, but it was revitalized in the late 20th century following major renovations.\nSignificant areas of the collection include antiquities, specifically their collection of Egyptian antiquities spanning over 3,000 years. European, African, Oceanic, and Japanese art make for notable antiquities collections as well. American art is heavily represented, starting at the Colonial period. Artists represented in the collection include Mark Rothko, Edward Hopper, Norman Rockwell, Judy Chicago, Winslow Homer, Edgar Degas, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Max Weber.

It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. It is the only known fully domed octagonal residence. The house was modeled after Donato Bramante\u2019s 1502 Tempietto in Rome, which in turn was based on a Tholos, a type of ancient classical temple.\nThe house was built in 1859\u20131860 by financier Paul J. Armour based on the architectural ideas of Orson Squire Fowler, the author of The Octagon House: A Home for All Occasions. Fowler believed that octagonal houses enclosed more space, provided more interior sunlight, and that its rooms were easily accessible to each other. Fowler's ideas gained significant traction in the mid-to-late 19th century.  The architect of the house is unknown. It is the only known octagonal house based on the domed colonnade shape of a Roman temple. The dome was added and the house was enlarged during 1872\u20131876 by Joseph Stiner, who was a tea importer. The Armour\u2013Stiner House is said to be one of the most lavish octagon houses built in the period, and is now one of only perhaps a hundred still extant.In the 1930s, the house was owned by Aleko E. E. Lilius, a Finnish writer and explorer, and from 1946 to 1976 by historian Carl Carmer, who maintained that the house was haunted. In 1976, the house was briefly owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to prevent it from being demolished. The Trust was unable to fund the amount of renovation the property required, and sold it to the preservationist architect, Joseph Pell Lombardi, who has conserved and renovated the house, interiors, grounds and outbuildings.The house remains a private residence. It is located on the south side of West Clinton Avenue, on the crest of a hill overlooking the Hudson River, to the west. It is about 1650 feet from the river, and about 140 feet above it, consistent with Fowler's siting ideas. The Old Croton Aqueduct, another National Historic Landmark, abuts the property on the east.\nIn September 2017, Lombardi offered the house for rent through Sotheby's, for $40,000 a month.",

She was captured on 4 June 1944 by United States Navy Task Group 22.3 (TG 22.3), one of six U-boats that were captured at sea by Allied forces during World War II. All but one of U-505's crew were rescued by the Navy task group. The submarine was towed to Bermuda in secret and her crew was interned at a US prisoner of war camp, where they were kept in isolation. The Navy classified the capture as top secret and went to great lengths to prevent the Germans from discovering it.\nIn 1954, U-505 was donated to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois.

        "long_description": "USS North Carolina (BB-55) is the lead ship of the North Carolina class of fast battleships, the first vessel of the type built for the United States Navy. Built under the Washington Treaty system, North Carolina's design was limited in displacement and armament, though the United States used a clause in the Second London Naval Treaty to increase the main battery from the original armament of twelve 14-inch (356 mm) guns in quadruple turrets to nine 16 in (406 mm) guns in triple turrets. The ship was laid down in 1937 and completed in April 1941, while the United States was still neutral during World War II.\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December, North Carolina mobilized for war and was initially sent to counter a possible sortie by the German battleship Tirpitz, though this did not materialize and North Carolina was promptly transferred to the Pacific to strengthen Allied forces during the Guadalcanal campaign. There, she screened aircraft carriers engaged in the campaign and took part in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24\u201325 August 1942, where she shot down several Japanese aircraft. The next month, she was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine but was not seriously damaged. After repairs, she returned to the campaign and continued to screen carriers during the campaigns across the central Pacific in 1943 and 1944, including the Gilberts and Marshall Islands and the Mariana and Palau Islands, where she saw action during the Battle of the Philippine Sea.\nThe ship was undergoing a refit during the invasion of the Philippines but took part in the later stages of the Philippines campaign and was present when the fleet was damaged by Typhoon Cobra. She took part in offensive operations in support of the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945, including numerous attacks on Japan. Following the surrender of Japan in August, she carried American personnel home during Operation Magic Carpet. North Carolina operated briefly off the east coast of the United States in 1946 before being decommissioned the next year and placed in reserve. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 1960, the ship was saved from the breaker's yard by a campaign to preserve the vessel as a museum ship in her namesake state. In 1962, the North Carolina museum was opened in Wilmington, North Carolina.",

        "long_description": "The Seagram Building is a skyscraper at 375 Park Avenue, between 52nd and 53rd Streets, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe along with Philip Johnson, Ely Jacques Kahn, and Robert Allan Jacobs, the high-rise tower is 515 feet (157 m) tall with 38 stories. The International Style building, completed in 1958, initially served as the headquarters of the Seagram Company, a Canadian distiller.\nPhyllis Lambert, daughter of Seagram CEO Samuel Bronfman, heavily influenced the Seagram Building's design, an example of the functionalist aesthetic and a prominent instance of corporate modern architecture. A glass curtain wall with vertical mullions of bronze and horizontal spandrels made of Muntz metal form the building's exterior. On Park Avenue is a pink-granite public plaza with two fountains. Behind the plaza is a tall elevator lobby with a similar design to the plaza. The lowest stories originally contained the Four Seasons and Brasserie restaurants, which were replaced respectively by the Grill and Pool restaurant and the Lobster Club. On the upper stories are modular office spaces.\nSeagram revealed plans for the building in July 1954, when it announced construction of its headquarters on the up-and-coming commercial strip of Park Avenue. After Lambert objected to Pereira & Luckman's original design, Mies was selected as the architect that November. The building's construction began in late 1955 and finished in 1958, although the official certificate of occupancy was not granted until 1959. The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA) purchased the building in 1979, and it remained Seagram's headquarters until 2001. TIAA sold the building in 2000 to Aby Rosen's RFR Holding LLC, which has continued to operate the structure.\nUpon opening, the Seagram Building was widely praised for its architecture. Described in The New York Times as one of \"New York's most copied buildings\", the Seagram Building has inspired the designs of other structures around the world. Within New York City, the Seagram Building helped influence the 1961 Zoning Resolution, a zoning ordinance that allowed developers to construct additional floor area in exchange for including plazas outside their buildings. In 1989, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Seagram Building's exterior, lobby, and The Four Seasons Restaurant as official city landmarks. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.",

The island is located at the southern end of the NWHI chain, 296 km (160 nmi) southeast of Necker Island.  Nihoa is the closest NWHI in proximity to the eight main windward Hawaiian Islands at approximately 240 km (130 nmi) northwest of the island of Kaua\u02bbi.  The island has two peaks, 272 m (892 ft) Miller's Peak in the west, and 259 m (850 ft) Tanager Peak in the east.  Nihoa's area is about 171 acres (0.69 km2) and is surrounded by a 142,000-acre (57,000 ha) coral reef.  Its jagged outline gives the island its name, N\u012bhoa, which is Hawaiian for \"toothed, serrated\".The island is home to 25 species of plants and several animals, making it the most diverse island in the entire NWHI. Endemic birds like the Nihoa finch and Nihoa millerbird, and endemic plants like Pritchardia remota and Schiedea verticillata are found only on Nihoa. Amaranthus brownii  was considered the rarest plant on Nihoa and has not been directly observed on the island since 1983, and is now considered to be extinct. The plant communities and rocky outcrops provide nesting and perching areas for 18 species of seabirds, such as red-footed boobies and brown noddies, terns, shearwaters, and petrels. Prehistoric evidence indicates Native Hawaiians lived on or visited the island around AD 1000, but over time the location of Nihoa was mostly forgotten, with only an oral legend preserving its name.  Captain James Colnett rediscovered the island in 1788, and Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu visited it in 1822. It was made part of the Kingdom of Hawaii by King Kamehameha IV.\nIn 1909, Nihoa became part of the Hawaiian Islands Reservation, a federal wildlife refuge established by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.  The Tanager Expedition surveyed the island in 1923, taking a comprehensive biological inventory of its many species. In 1940, it became part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Wildlife Refuge and in 1988, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places due to its culturally significant archaeological sites. In 2006, it became part of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument. Efforts are underway to ensure that endangered plant species are propagated beyond their limited range and represented in ex situ collections. Persons intending to visit Nihoa for cultural and scientific research purposes require a USFWS-issued special-use permit to land on the island so as to reduce the risk of introducing alien species to Nihoa's already fragile ecosystem.",

The site contains the ruins of a pueblo estimated to be 500 years old, as well as those of a 17th-century Spanish mission.  It was visited in the 16th century by members of Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's exploratory expedition.  In the 1930s, Hopi artist Fred Kabotie was commissioned by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University to reproduce the prehistoric murals found during the excavation of the Awatovi Ruins.  The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964.\nThe site has been studied, and now even the campsite of the archeologists is itself of archeological interest:  the Awatovi Expedition of the Peabody Museum campsite is itself deemed an archeological site worthy of further study.",

The district is located on both sides of North Michigan Avenue between East Chicago and East Pearson Streets.  It includes the Chicago Water Tower, Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, and Chicago Fire Department Fire Station No. 98.  All three structures are part of the Chicago Landmark district designated on October 6, 1971 (amended June 10, 1981).   The Water Tower and Pumping Station were jointly added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1975. In addition the Tower was named an American Water Landmark in 1969. The Water Tower was also one of the few buildings to survive the Great Chicago Fire. The district is the namesake of the nearby Water Tower Place.The district was once called Tower Town or Towertown and was known for its bohemian artists and nightlife in the early 20th century. In the 1910s, artists moved into an area near Pine St (now North Michigan Avenue) that was being deserted by affluent residents. Tower Town was the resultant artistic district, and it was successful in part because of its proximity to affluent patrons who remained on the Gold Coast. A new bridge connecting the area to the Chicago Loop helped transform Tower Town into an expensive commercial district. Bars and nightclubs in the area included Chez Pierre, the Dil Pickle Club, Kelly's Stables, the Little Club, the Paradise Club and the Tent.\n\n",

It is located north of Downtown Seattle in the 74-acre (30 ha) entertainment complex known as Seattle Center, the site of the 1962 World's Fair, for which it was originally developed. After opening in 1962, it was subsequently bought and converted by the city of Seattle for entertainment purposes. From 2018 to 2021, the arena underwent a $1.15 billion redevelopment; the renovation preserved the original exterior and roof, which was declared a Seattle Landmark in 2017 and was listed on the Washington Heritage Register as well as the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. The renovated venue has a capacity of 17,151 for ice hockey and 18,300 for basketball.The arena is currently the home to the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Seattle Storm of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the Seattle University Redhawks men's basketball team, and the Rat City Roller Derby league of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association. It has also played host to the Pac-12 Conference's women's basketball tournament.\nThe arena was previously most notable as the long-time former home of the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The SuperSonics first played at the facility, then known as the Seattle Center Coliseum, from their founding in 1967 to 1978. After a seven-season stint in the higher capacity Kingdome, they returned to the arena in 1985. The facility underwent an extensive renovation after the 1993\u201394 season, which necessitated the relocation of SuperSonics home games to the Tacoma Dome for the 1994\u201395 season, and it was renamed KeyArena after KeyCorp bought the naming rights in 1995. The SuperSonics left KeyArena in 2008 amid a controversial relocation to Oklahoma City. The arena was also known for hosting minor professional hockey teams, first as home to the Seattle Totems of the original Western Hockey League and the Central Hockey League from 1964 to 1975, followed by the Seattle Thunderbirds of the current Western Hockey League from 1989 to 2008.\nThe arena was the first publicly financed one in the area that was fully supported by earned income from the building. Arena finances were bolstered for several years by a payment following the settlement with the SuperSonics in 2008, but the lower level of activity and revenue during the time between the departure of the team and the arrival of the NHL left little reserve beyond basic building maintenance. The naming rights deal with KeyCorp concluded at the end of 2010, but the building maintained the KeyArena name until its 2018 closure for the redevelopment. Amazon bought the naming rights to the arena in June 2020, dedicating the arena name to bringing attention to climate change.",

The stone structure is a double-pen building built into an embankment downhill from the main house. The western end is older, with two connecting rooms and a cellar, accessible through a hole in the floor. The eastern end consists of two rooms, connected to the original wing by a breezeway. Each block has a central chimney with two hearths. The walls are stone rubble construction with timber roof construction. A loft, probably a later addition, has been created in the attic space. The floors are dirt, except for the room over the cellar, which is wood. The roof is asphalt roll roofing over plywood, but traces of the older wood shake roof remain. There are several window openings which do not appear to have been glazed, but rather shuttered.The Lewis plantation was established between 1744 and 1746 by Vincent Lewis, who owned a number of slaves, whose numbers increased with succeeding generations. The Lewis family sold the property for development in the 1980s.The Arcola slave quarters were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 26, 2008 as local examples of extant slave quarters, and as an unusual example of stone slave quarters.

The lodge was chartered in 1885.The cornerstone for the Arkansas Valley Lodge was laid on April 3, 1910. The Architect and Contractor for the building was Joshua (Josiah) Walker. Joshua (Josiah) Walker was an experienced plasterer, bricklayer and contractor as well as the operator of a real estate office and a boarding house. He was a man \"well though of\" and a pillar to the local black community. He had three sons Richard, Reuben and Edward. Joshua died July 24, 1923, but not after he had designed and built many other churches around 1900 including the Baptist church at Elm and Water in Wichita. Walker's brother, Sam Jones, completed the construction of the Arkansas Valley Lodge, one of the buildings built during Wichita's second \"Boom Age,\" which began in the 1880s.  The original building as designed by Joshua Walker was to consist of a 26' x 80' feet building with \"thirteen inch thick walls and a concrete foundation.\" At the time, the Wichita Eagle simply listed J. Walker as a Plasterer and the black newspaper The Searchlight lists him as the Architect of Record.\nThe Beacon and the Wichita Eagle both contain accounts of the cornerstone laying from April 2 and 3 1910 in which a \"daily paper, lodge archives, coins and all the accepted articles thus encased in a corner stone..\" were included. The items in the cornerstone was discovered by Bradley Hardin an intern at Law Kingdon Architects in Wichita during its renovation. The items are now in display in the lobby of the building.\nThe building was completed with three floors. The first floor was rented to various businesses, the second floor was used as a recreation and community center and the third floor was the meeting room of the lodge, complete with a skylight. Local historian, Gerald Norwood and Mr. A.E. Titchenor a General Chairman of the lodge recount that the building originally had hardwood floors, tin ceilings and painted green window frames. According to Mr. Titchenor, the low budget for the project didn't allow for high end items with the exception of the first floor that had some chandeliers. The doors were originally trimmed in wood and the walls were white painted plaster. The Lodge underwent many renovations over the years including a plumbing renovation in 1912, the addition of a fire escape and skylight repair in 1919, a reflooring of the tile in 1955 and a new roof added in 1969.\nIt is unclear at what point the building went from a three-story structure to a two-story structure.\nOn April 29, 1974, the Urban Renewal Authority purchased the building for $28,875. The building was scheduled to be torn down in 1975, but a visiting professor at Wichita State University named Maya Angelou, the now famous poet, offered a challenge to her students to \"explore black history, the forgotten history of Wichita.\" As a product of this movement, and after much resistance, the building was put on the local historic register in 1978.\nConstructed to be a local Prince Hall Freemasons Lodge in 1910, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.  It has also been known as Black Masonic Lodge.",

Members of the Dunkard Brethren Church, they typified the German immigrant church's gradual movement westward as it gradually integrated with American society.  After renting land over their first winter, Arnold bought the present farmstead from Henry Harshberger and occupied it for the remnant of his life.  The family used a log cabin during their first years at the site before significantly improving their lives by constructing the present house in 1835.Built of brick, the farmhouse rests on a stone foundation, is topped by an asphalt roof, and features additional elements of wood and asphalt.  The basic plan is a simple two-story rectangle, wider than its length, with windowless ends that rise to chimney-topped gables.  An extension, most of the width of the house, is attached to the rear, while a porch occupies the ell.  Three windows pierce the second story on the facade, while the main entrance sits at the center of the first story between one window on either side.  A small porch with a shed roof shelters the entrance.  Besides the farmhouse, the complex includes a cemetery and six outbuildings, including the original log cabin and a bank barn.Today, the Arnold farmstead is the core of Carriage Hill MetroPark.  The farmhouse is operated as a historic house museum, staffed by individuals costumed as nineteenth-century farmers, while other parts of the farmstead are operated for ancillary purposes.  The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of Daniel Arnold's significance in the area's settlement.  It is one of four Huber Heights locations on the Register, along with the Ausenbaugh-McElhenny House, the Taylorsville Canal Inn (demolished), and Lock Seventy on the Miami and Erie Canal.",

The three-story brick building on Memorial Drive was constructed by the company to meet increasing demand for laboratory space, and is an architecturally unexceptional commercial structure.  The building was declared a National Historic Landmark for its association with the Little company, the first business to be established as a consulting laboratory in the nation.  Prior to its founding, individual businesses established their own research laboratories to make technological innovations.  Little, and his partner William H. Walker, were among the first academically oriented researchers to create a consulting laboratory whose services could be hired by businesses.  At first focused on the chemistry of cellulose and its uses in textiles and paper, the company was by 1909 the largest consulting industrial laboratory in the nation, and worked a wide array of research disciplines.  Little was an early advocate of the importance of technological innovation, recognizing its importance in maintaining commercial success. He ran the company until his death in 1935, and willed his shares to MIT.\nThe building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.",

The district's area has long been commercial; from its earliest years, the street running through the district was known as Bridge Street, because it terminates at a bridge spanning the Ashtabula River.  Until it became part of the city of Ashtabula in the 1870s, Ashtabula Harbor was a separate municipality (it lies two miles north of the city's downtown), and Bridge Street its commercial sector.  The area's buildings vary greatly in appearance, with some surpassing others by several feet.  Designs include examples of the Italianate, Queen Anne, and Neoclassical styles, while the construction materials are primarily brick with occasional frame structures.The Ashtabula Harbor Commercial District was designated in 1975 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the same time, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in area history; it gained this designation largely because it retains its late nineteenth-century appearance as a flourishing harbor's business district.  Seventy-five contributing properties are located within the district's boundaries.  In 1978, the city government created the Ashtabula Harbor Historical District, a substantially larger area including numerous residential streets as well as the federally designated commercial street.  Since 2010, the city district's boundaries have extended from the river bridge to Lake Avenue and from Morton Drive along the river to the Walnut Beach Park on the lake.  City ordinance forbids exterior alterations to buildings in the federally designated district unless the owner has first completed a process of gaining approval from the city's historic preservation review board.",

The church building, restored in the early 21st century, is largely intact from its original construction.\nDuring the work, the largest organ on the Western Slope was installed. The church, often compared to a fortress or castle in appearance, has been a popular local music venue and is used annually by the Aspen Music Festival for recitals.

After Martha died in childbirth in Linn City in the Willamette Valley, Fanno and his son settled a 640-acre (2.6 km2) donation land claim 12 miles (19 km) to the northwest on a small tributary of the Tualatin River. It was the first such claim to be filed in the county.In 1851, Fanno married Rebecca Denney, and the first of their six children was born later that year. In 1859, he designed and built a rural home in the modified New England revival style popular in Oregon at the time. The family pioneered the cultivation of onions in Oregon, and by the 1890s these became regionally recognized for their high quality. Fanno descendants produced onions on the farm until onion maggots drove them out of business in the 1940s. Members of the family occupied the farmhouse until 1974, and in March 1982 they donated the house and adjacent land to the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD).\nFanno Farmhouse remains on its original site along Fanno Creek in the Portland, Oregon, suburb of Beaverton. Restored by THPRD, the house is on the National Register of Historic Places, was honored as a significant historical site by Tualatin Valley Heritage, has been named a Century Farm, and was nominated for the 1985 Griffin Cabin Award by the Washington County Historical Society.",

Looff as a gift for Looff's daughter Emma Vogel and her husband Louis Vogel, who owned Natatorium Park in Spokane. It remained at Natatorium Park until 1968 when the park closed. The carousel was then relocated to its present location at Riverfront Park in 1975 where it continues to operate.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 19, 1977.\nThe Looff still contains its original 1900 Ruth & Sohn band organ, which plays 87 key B.A.B. rolls, although due to deteriorating player rolls, a digitized recording is played during the carousel's operation. The organ was manufactured in Waldkirch, Germany and imported by Looff around 1900. The carousel contains 54 horses, one giraffe, one tiger, one goat and two chariots, all hand carved by Looff himself. It also has a ring dispenser, which allows the outside riders to grab a ring during each pass and then toss the ring at a clown with a hole for his mouth. If the rider is successful in capturing the brass ring, they can turn it in to win a free ride on the carousel.Since 1975, the carousel has been located on the south bank of the Spokane River in Riverfront Park. The park was constructed for the 1974 World's Fair, and certain structures remained in the park after the fair closed. The building that hosted a German beer garden for the fair became the new home of the carousel in the summer of 1975.\nAs a part of a bond passed in 2014 to revitalize Riverfront Park, a new building was designed to house the carousel. The new building was designed with more space to queue and host events, and large windows to improve views of the Spokane River from the inside and views of the carousel from the outside. The new space opened in 2018.During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Carrousel and other building amenities were closed for nearly a year. The pandemic forced a closure of the attraction on March 17, 2020, but the ride resumed operations on March 1, 2021. During the pandemic, a new ride was added when the local toy and sporting goods store founded in 1946, the White Elephant, decided to close its doors and its beloved white elephant ride that adorned the front entrance for decades was gifted to the city in July 2020. The elephant, known as Isidore, was formerly featured in Natatorium Park alongside the carousel and was reunited with the carousel animals in the Looff building.",

Stier planned the house in 1801 to resemble his Belgian residence, the Chateau du Mick. Four years later, Stier returned to Belgium, leaving the unfinished Riversdale to be completed by his daughter, Rosalie Stier Calvert and her husband, George Calvert, the son of Benedict Swingate Calvert, who was a natural son of The 5th Baron Baltimore.  Rosalie and George Calvert's son, Charles Benedict Calvert, established the Maryland Agricultural College, now the University of Maryland, College Park, on part of the Riversdale property.\nWhile its design has been attributed to William Thornton, this is not supported by available evidence on Thornton's career.

It passes through Nahant Beach Reservation, a state park offering beach access on the isthmus. The road offers expansive views of the area coastlines and Boston Harbor. Both the park and the roadway are administered by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.\nNahant Beach Boulevard was first laid out in 1905, as part of the Metropolitan District Commission's program of developing oceanfront parkways, and provided the first paved road access to Nahant. It was designed by the firm of Olmsted, Olmsted, and Eliot, predecessor to the Olmsted Brothers landscape design firm. Around the same time, rail access and a bridle path were also added to the isthmus.In 1936 that roadway alignment was converted into a parking area, and the present roadway was completed the following year on the alignment of the railroad bed. The Lynn Rotary was completed in 1935. This work, along with the conversion of the bridle path to a promenade, was paid for by Works Progress Administration grants. Since then modifications to the roadway have been modest. Seawalls have been built, a chain link fence was installed on the wall between the road and the parking lot, and the rotary was landscaped.When the roadway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, the designation included, in addition to the roadway itself, the Lynn Rotary and the Spanish\u2013American War Memorial located in the rotary; a second memorial, the Aliferis Monument, postdates the period of significance for the listing.",

The station serves as an alternative stop for Amtrak riders traveling through the Washington area, analogous to the role Newark Penn Station plays in the New York area.\nIt is located directly across the tracks from the King Street\u2013Old Town station of the Washington Metro. Since the opening of the Metro station in 1983, the city has touted the station as an intermodal hub for regional mass transit, linking Amtrak, VRE, and Metro with a number of Alexandria DASH and Metrobus lines. The Virginia Department of Transportation and Northern Virginia Transportation Authority have plans to build a pedestrian tunnel between Union Station and King Street-Old Town; presently, those transferring from Amtrak to Metro must walk about 600 feet (180 m) along King Street.The original passenger terminal, a one-story brick building completed in 1905, is still in use. Unlike most stations from the era, it was built in the Federal Revival style. The station was extensively renovated in 1982, with further improvements in the mid-1990s. The stone and concrete Veterans of Foreign Wars memorial was constructed at the station in 1940.",

        "long_description": "The Hotel Chelsea (also the Chelsea Hotel; colloquially the Chelsea) is a hotel at 222 West 23rd Street in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Built between 1883 and 1884, the hotel was designed by Philip Hubert in a style described variously as Queen Anne Revival and Victorian Gothic. The 12-story Chelsea, originally a housing cooperative, has been the home of numerous writers, musicians, artists, and entertainers, some of whom still lived there in the 21st century. As of 2022, most of the Chelsea is used as a luxury hotel. The building is a New York City designated landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe front facade of the Hotel Chelsea is 11 stories high, while the rear of the hotel rises 12 stories. The facade is divided vertically into five sections and is made of brick, with some flower-ornamented iron balconies; the hotel is capped by a high mansard roof. The Hotel Chelsea has thick load-bearing walls made of masonry, as well as wrought iron floor beams and large, column-free spaces. When the hotel opened, the ground floor was divided into an entrance hall, four storefronts, and a restaurant; this has been rearranged over the years, with a bar and the El Quijote restaurant occupying part of the ground floor. The Chelsea was among the first buildings in the city with duplex and penthouse apartments, and there is also a rooftop terrace. The hotel originally had no more than 100 apartments; it was subdivided into 400 units during the 20th century and has 155 units as of 2022.\nThe idea for the Chelsea arose after Hubert & Pirsson had developed several housing cooperatives in New York City. Developed by the Chelsea Association, the structure quickly attracted authors and artists after opening. Several factors, including financial hardships and tenant relocations, prompted the Chelsea's conversion into an apartment hotel in 1905. Knott Hotels took over the hotel in 1921 and managed it until about 1942, when David Bard bought it out of bankruptcy. Julius Krauss and Joseph Gross joined Bard as owners in 1947. After David Bard died in 1964, his son Stanley operated it for 43 years, forming close relationships with many tenants. The hotel underwent numerous minor changes in the late 20th century after falling into a state of disrepair. The Krauss and Gross families took over the hotel in 2007 and were involved in numerous tenant disputes before the Chelsea closed for a major renovation in 2011. The hotel changed ownership twice in the 2010s before BD Hotels took over in 2016, and the Chelsea reopened in 2022.\nOver the years, the Chelsea has housed many notables such as Arthur Miller, Bob Dylan, Arthur C. Clarke, Patti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Virgil Thomson. The Chelsea received much commentary for the creative culture that Bard helped create within the hotel. Critics also appraised the hotel's interior\u2014which was reputed for its uncleanliness in the mid- and late 20th century\u2014and the quality of the hotel rooms themselves. The Chelsea has been the setting or inspiration for many works of popular media, and it has been used as an event venue and filming location.",

Access to United First Parish Church, where the Adamses worshipped and are buried, is provided by the congregation, for which they ask a small donation. The Church of the Presidents is across the town square from the Visitors Center and provides tours on a regular basis.\n\n",

The park was established in 1892 for \"the free use of all the people for their health and pleasure\", and for watershed protection. At 6.1 million acres (2.5\u00d710^6 ha), it is the largest park in the contiguous United States.Unlike most parks in the U.S., about 52 percent of the land is privately owned inholdings. The remaining 48 percent is publicly owned by the state as part of the Forest Preserve. Use of public and private lands in the park is regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency.The Adirondack Park contains 46 High Peaks, 2,800 lakes and ponds, 30,000 miles (48,000 km) of rivers and streams,  and an estimated 200,000 acres (81,000 ha) of old-growth forests. It is home to 105 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and a timber-harvesting industry. The park has a population of 130,000 permanent and 200,000 seasonal residents, and sees over 12.4 million annual visitors. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the most successful experiments in conserving previously developed lands in the industrialized world.The Adirondack Forest Preserve was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963.",

Although the United States ostensibly ceded the fort after it gained independence in the American Revolutionary War, the British stayed until 1796. Transfer to the U.S. came after signing of the Jay Treaty that reaffirmed and implemented the legal border with British Canada. Although the US Army deactivated the fort in 1963, the Coast Guard continues to have a presence. A non-profit group operates the fort and grounds as a state park and preserves it in part as a museum and site for historical re-enactments.

The villages were built and settled by German Radical Pietists, who were persecuted in their homeland by the German state government and the Lutheran Church. Calling themselves the True Inspiration Congregations (German: Wahre Inspirations-Gemeinden), they first settled in New York near Buffalo in what is now the town of West Seneca. However, seeking more isolated surroundings, they moved to Iowa (near present-day Iowa City) in 1856. They lived a communal life until 1932.\nFor eighty years, the Amana Colony maintained an almost completely self-sufficient local economy, importing very little from the industrializing American economy. The Amanians were able to achieve this independence and lifestyle by adhering to the specialized crafting and farming occupations that they had brought with them from Europe. Craftsmen passed their skills and techniques on from one generation to the next. They used hand, horse, wind, and water power, and made their own furniture, clothes, and other goods. The community voted to form a for-profit organization during the Great Depression, the Amana Society (Amana-Gesellschaft), which included the Amana Corporation.\nToday, the Seven Villages of Amana are a tourist attraction known for their restaurants and craft shops. The colony was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1965.\nAs of the 2010 Census, the population of the seven villages in order of population was as follows:\n\nMiddle Amana (581)\nAmana (Main Amana) (442)\nSouth Amana (159)\nHomestead (148)\nWest Amana (135)\nHigh Amana (115)\nEast Amana (56)",

It was designed by Raymond Hood and Andr\u00e9 Fouilhoux in the Gothic and Art Deco styles for the American Radiator Company. The original section of the American Radiator Building, a 338 ft-tall (103 m), 23-story tower, was completed in 1924. A five-story annex, to the west of the original tower, was built from 1936 to 1937.\nThe original structure consists of an eighteen-story tower above a base of five stories, while the western annex only rises five stories. The American Radiator Building's facade is made predominantly of black brick. Gold-colored decorations are used on the building's setbacks and pinnacles. Hood had intended for the original structure to be a standalone shaft, requiring the building to be set back from the lot line and reducing the maximum amount of space available. Inside, the basement, first, and second floors were originally designed as exhibition showrooms, while the upper stories served as office space.\nThe building was completed five years before the American Radiator Company merged with Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company to form American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation, later known as American Standard. American Standard sold the building in 1988 to a Japanese company. The main building was sold in 1998 to Philip Pilevsky, who opened the Bryant Park Hotel there in 2001. The annex operated as the Katharine Gibbs School from 2001 to 2009 and was converted into the City University of New York's Guttman Community College in 2012. The American Radiator Building is a New York City designated landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.",

        "long_description": "Fort Snelling is a former military fortification and National Historic Landmark in the U.S. state of Minnesota on the bluffs overlooking the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. The military site was initially named Fort Saint Anthony, but it was renamed Fort Snelling once its construction was completed in 1825.\nBefore the American Civil War, the U.S. Army supported slavery at the fort by allowing its soldiers to bring their personal enslaved people. These included African Americans Dred Scott and Harriet Robinson Scott, who lived at the fort in the 1830s. In the 1840s, the Scotts sued for their freedom, arguing that having lived in \"free territory\" made them free, leading to the landmark United States Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford. Slavery ended at the fort just before Minnesota statehood in 1858.\nThe fort served as the primary center for U.S. government forces during the Dakota War of 1862. It also was the site of the concentration camp where eastern Dakota and Ho-chunk non-combatants awaited riverboat transport in their forced removal from Minnesota when hostilities ceased. The fort served as a recruiting station during the Civil War, Spanish\u2013American War, and both World Wars before being decommissioned a second time in 1946. It then fell into a state of disrepair until the lower post was restored to its original appearance in 1965. At that time, all that remained of the original lower post were the round and hexagonal towers. Many of the important buildings of the upper post remain today with some still in disrepair.\nThe historic fort is in the unorganized territory of Fort Snelling within Hennepin County, bordering Ramsey and Dakota counties.\nThere are now multiple government agencies that own portions of the former fort with the Minnesota Historical Society administering the Historic Fort Snelling site. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources administers Fort Snelling State Park at the bottom of the bluff. Fort Snelling once encompassed the park's land. It has been cited as a \"National Treasure\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The historic fort is in the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a National Park Service unit.\n\n",

The structure is one of the three Georgian Gothic Revival churches on the Lower East Side with the other ones being St. Augustine's Chapel and the Church of the Transfiguration. It is also the second oldest church building in New York City.\nThe church stands on land that was once part of Henry Rutgers' estate, which he  donated in 1816 to establish the Northeast Dutch Reformed Church (also known as the Market Street Church). Rutgers served on the consistory. Noted minister Theodore L. Cuyler was pastor from 1853 to 1860 when he accepted a position at Park Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn. The church's organ was built by Henry Erben and dates to 1841.By 1866, most of the Dutch Reformed congregation had moved uptown, and shipping merchant Hanson K. Corning purchased the building on behalf of the Presbytery of New-York to serve seamen and their families. The Sea and Land Church sponsored steamboat excursions for its Sunday School to Dudley's Grove, just below Hastings-on-Hudson. In 1894, the church affiliated with the Madison Square Presbyterian Church as a means of survival, but this did not last.Since 1951, the church building has been used by the First Chinese Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church (USA), which shared the site with the Sea and Land Church until 1972 when that congregation was dissolved. In 1974 the Presbytery of New York City officially transferred the church building to the First Chinese Presbyterian Church.\n\n",

Erected in 1888 on Main Street in downtown Cedarville, it has been a premier part of community life since its construction.Built of brick with elements of stone, the opera house is a Romanesque Revival structure that has served a wide range of purposes in the community.  Besides its primary function as a home for the performing arts, the two-and-a-half-story building has housed the offices of Cedarville's mayor and village council, its jail, its fire and police departments, its waterworks, as well as the township trustees' office for Cedarville Township.  When Cedarville's was built, the opera house as an institution was a center of social life in rural Ohio: the public sphere was nearly nonexistent except for the village opera house, which typically served as a meeting place for travelling vaudeville acts, political events, musical performances, and graduation ceremonies.  Because the first floor has always been used as offices for the various organizations that used the building, public events were typically held on the second floor, which has been little modified by the years; it is one of Ohio's least changed historic performance halls.In 1984, the Cedarville Opera House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in local history.  It is one of two National Register-listed properties in Cedarville and one of two National Register-listed opera houses in Greene County, along with the Harper Mausoleum and George W.

Atlantic currents in this area made for excellent travel for ships, except in the area of Diamond Shoals, just offshore at Cape Hatteras.  Nearby, the warm Gulf Stream ocean current collides with the colder Labrador Current, creating ideal conditions for powerful ocean storms and sea swells.  The large number of ships that ran aground because of these shifting sandbars gave this area the nickname \"Graveyard of the Atlantic.\"  It also led the U.S. Congress to authorize the construction of the Cape Hatteras Light. Its 198-foot height makes it the tallest brick lighthouse structure in the United States and 2nd in the world. Since its base is almost at sea level, it is only the 15th highest light in the United States, the first 14 being built on higher ground.",

It was the home of Wadsworth Atheneum director Arthur Everett \"Chick\" Austin Jr. Chick Austin built the house in 1930 after seeing the Palladian Villas of the Veneto on his honeymoon. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994, for its distinctive architectural style and for its association with Austin, the Atheneum's director 1927\u20131944.The house is a neo-Palladian homage to Vincenzo Scamozzi's Villa Ferreti, built in 1596 in Dolo, Republic of Venice.The house, only one room deep, is long and narrow, 86 feet in length by 18 feet in depth. In the front elevation, the central three-bay pedimented pavilion is flanked by four-bay wings. The bays are defined by shallow, two-story Ionic pilasters. The walls of the pavilion and wings are in the same plane, since the pavilion does not project. The planar effect is emphasized by the wall sheathing, which is flush boarding, tongue-in-groove. The twelve flat pilasters rise with entasis from bases of double torus moldings to stylized Ionic capitals. Two string courses, one at first-floor ceiling height, the other below second-floor window sills, establish a horizontal orientation to balance the strong upward thrust of the pilasters.\nFour stone steps lead up to the double front door in the central bay of the pavilion. Above the door, a balustrade is suggested by half-round, vase-shaped balusters applied to the spandrel under the tall, double round-arched window. First- and second-floor windows in the flanking bays of the pavilion are blind. Windows in the wings are double casements, four panes high at the first floor, three at the second; two are blind at each floor. The pavilion pilasters support a plain architrave and pulvinated frieze. The pediment above is without embellishment in its tympanum, and is wider than the cross gable behind it. The entablature continues under the eaves of the cross-gable roof.\nAfter Austin's departure from Hartford in 1946, Helen Goodwin Austin remained in residence. In 1985, she and her two children, David and Sarah Austin, donated the house to the Wadsworth Atheneum, which provides guided visits of the property.\nIt is among the homes featured in Bob Vila's Guide to Historic Homes: In Search of Palladio, a six-hour A&E Network study of the work and influence of the Renaissance architect  Andrea Palladio.

Designed by Irish American architect Patrick Keely to accommodate Albany's growing population of Catholic immigrants, it is the second-oldest cathedral in the state, after St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. It is also the third oldest Catholic cathedral in the United States, and the first American Catholic cathedral in the Neo-Gothic architectural style.The interior features the original stained glass windows, imported from England, and award-winning Stations of the Cross statuary. When completed, it was the tallest building in Albany. It has hosted visits by cardinals and leaders of other faiths, including one Archbishop of Canterbury, and the weddings of two Catholic governors' daughters. In 1986 it hosted the first-ever service of forgiveness between Catholics and Jews on Palm Sunday, an event commemorated by a sculpture outside the building.\nConstruction of the cathedral, at the behest of the diocese's first bishop, John McCloskey, took four years. Its south tower took 40, and it was not consecrated until its 50th anniversary in 1902. The construction of Empire State Plaza, the nearby New York state government complex, threatened the cathedral in the 1960s when it required the demolition of most of the surrounding neighborhood. It has been through several renovations in its history, including a $30 million restoration early in the 21st century.",

The upper stories contain the Cipriani South Street event space, operated by Cipriani S.A., and a 47-room hotel called Casa Cipriani.\nThe Beaux-Arts building was built from 1906 to 1909 and designed by the firm Walker and Morris as the easternmost section of the partially completed Whitehall Street Ferry Terminal. What is now the Battery Maritime Building was designed to serve ferries traveling to Brooklyn. The structure uses a variety of architectural metals and originally contained a large waiting area on the second floor. The Battery Maritime Building is the only Exposition Universelle-style ferry building still operating in Manhattan. The similarly-designed westernmost section of the Whitehall Street Ferry Terminal, serving ferries to Staten Island, was rebuilt as the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal; the center section was never built.\nThe terminal was used by Brooklyn ferry routes until the mid-20th century and subsequently fell into disrepair. The building was used as a Governors Island ferry terminal starting in 1956, while the upper floors were used by various city agencies, including the Department of Marine and Aviation beginning in 1959. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as a city landmark in 1967 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The underused structure was proposed to be converted into a cultural center during the 1980s as part of the failed South Ferry Plaza development. The exterior was restored by Jan Hird Pokorny Architects between 2001 and 2005.

It was located on Magnuson's Island on the Northwest Angle of Minnesota, 3.5 miles east of Angle Inlet, Minnesota and one mile southwest of Penasse, Minnesota, the most northerly point in that state. The site of the modern reconstruction may be somewhat different since the lake levels were raised by control structures on the Winnipeg River. For related forts, see Winnipeg River.\nLa V\u00e9rendrye reached the north shore of Lake Superior in late 1731 and sent men ahead to build Fort St. Pierre on Rainy Lake. In July or August 1732 he, his eldest son Jean Baptiste de La V\u00e9rendrye, his nephew Christopher Dufrost de La Jemeraye, Father Charles-Michel Mesaiger and 50 canoes of Indians left Fort Saint Pierre and built Fort Saint Charles on Lake of the Woods. The fort was 60 by 100 feet with two gates and a double row of 15-foot palisades and four bastions and a watch tower. The internal buildings were roofed with bark. There was abundant fishing, hunting and wild rice, an important matter since it was difficult to haul food from Montreal or Fort Michilimackinac. Next spring he sent Jean Baptiste and La Jameraye down the Winnipeg. They got to within 15 or 20 leagues of the lake when they were blocked by ice. The English on Hudson Bay reported increased activity of Coureurs des bois west of the fort, but La V\u00e9rendrye said nothing about them in his reports. On the first of January 1734 a group of Assiniboines reached the fort and brought the Europeans their first news of the Mandans. Some time after this two of his men returned from Lake Winnipeg and the first Fort Maurepas (Canada) was built soon after. In 1735 La Jameraye's men returned to the Lake from the Red River of the North via the Roseau River (Manitoba-Minnesota), Portage de la Savanne and Reed River.\nOn June 6, 1736 an expedition departed from Fort Saint Charles, consisting of Jean Baptiste de La V\u00e9rendrye (the eldest son) with the Jesuit missionary priest Father Jean-Pierre Aulneau and nineteen French-Canadian voyageurs. They were headed for Fort Michilimackinac. They had traveled only a few kilometres from the fort when they were attacked by Sioux, who killed everyone in the party. The Sioux were retaliating against La V\u00e9rendrye p\u00e8re, who they believed was trading guns to their traditional enemies, the Cree and Assiniboine. The expedition members were killed on a small island, called Massacre Island, Ontario, however historians have been unable to reach consensus on its exact identity. After the massacre was discovered, La V\u00e9rendrye p\u00e8re directed that the bodies of his son and the priest, and the heads of the 19 voyageurs, be brought back for burial at Fort Saint Charles. The remains of his son and the priest were buried under the altar stone of the chapel, and the voyageurs were buried outside.\nThe fort was abandoned in 1749.",

The Spanish Colonial Revival style station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a San Diego Historic Landmark. Its architecture, particularly the signature twin domes, is often echoed in the design of modern buildings in Downtown San Diego.\nThe historic depot is located in the Core district of Downtown San Diego and is still an active transportation center, providing services to Amtrak California intercity trains, Coaster  commuter rail trains, the San Diego Trolley, and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System bus system.\nThe Santa Fe Depot (as it was originally designated) officially opened on March 8, 1915, to accommodate visitors to the Panama-California Exposition. The depot was completed during a particularly optimistic period in the city's development and represents the battle waged by the City of San Diego to become the West Coast terminus of the Santa Fe's transcontinental railroad, a fight that was ultimately lost to the City of Los Angeles.\nIn its heyday, the facility not only handled Santa Fe traffic but also that of the San Diego and Arizona Railway (SD&A) and San Diego Electric Railway (SDERy). The designation was officially changed to \"San Diego Union Station\" in response to the SD&A's completion of its own transcontinental line in December 1919. Santa Fe resumed solo operation of the station in January 1951 when the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway (successor to the SD&A) discontinued passenger service, the SDERy having ceased operation some two years prior.\nOf the 77 California stations served by Amtrak in Fiscal Year 2017, the Santa Fe Depot was the third busiest in California (behind only Los Angeles Union Station and Sacramento Valley Station) and the 10th busiest in the Amtrak system, boarding or detraining an average of approximately 2,130 passengers daily.",

The politically connected Weber Brothers, Edward Addison Weber and Christian C. Weber received and handled the commission officially. However, because neither appears to have any architectural or design training, \"the actual designer appears to have been John Scudder Adkins (1872-1931), a well-trained and talented St. Louis-born architect who moved to Cincinnati in 1893.\" Adkins designed several notable commercial and institutional buildings as well as residences throughout the mid-west. John Adkins and G.S. Werner were partners in a firm prior to merging with as the Weber brothers' firm. The firm was selected from among four firms invited to submit plans.The new mansion replaced the Old Governor's Mansion, built in 1798, which still stands, at 420 High Street, Frankfort. The Act specified that the new mansion should be \"constructed, trimmed and finished with native stone produced from quarries in Kentucky.\" The Beaux-Arts design owed a great deal to the Petit Trianon at Versailles' interiors were in neoclassical French taste. The landscaping design for the mansion was developed and implemented by William Speed of Louisville.\nIn 1980, Kentucky's First Lady, Phyllis George Brown, began a fundraising effort called Save the Mansion, designed to fund the restoration of the interior and furnish the building. The restoration project was completed in the spring of 1983. The Governor's Mansion Preservation Foundation is a charitable trust that is charged with conservation of the historic structure. The Governor's Mansion is regularly open for tours.",

It was built in 1846 by Sam Barlow and Philip Foster, with authorization of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon, and served as the last overland segment of the Oregon Trail. Its construction allowed covered wagons to cross the Cascade Range and reach the Willamette Valley, which had previously been nearly impossible. Even so, it was by far the most harrowing 100 miles (160 km) of the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200 km) Oregon Trail.Before the opening of the Barlow Road, pioneers traveling by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass on the north side of Mount Hood, but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons. A trading post (allowed by the Department of War) had been built where river crossings could be made along with the disassembly of wagons to make rafts suitable for floating down the remainder of the Columbia.The Barlow Road begins at Wascopam Mission and heads south to Tygh Valley (some consider Tygh Valley the origin), then turns west and roughly parallels the White River on the north and then west, crosses the south shoulder of Mount Hood at Barlow Pass, follows Camp Creek and the Sandy River for some way, and finally leads to Oregon City. The road was rendered largely irrelevant in the early 1900s by the construction of the Mount Hood Highway. It still exists as a dirt road in some places, while many other parts have been paved over by newer streets and highways.",

This landmark of the Chicago school of architecture gained fame for being one of the earliest commercial buildings constructed with a metal skeleton frame remaining in the United States.\nBuilt in 1891 by Levi Z. Leiter, (1834\u20131904), the Second Leiter Building was designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney, who implemented the skeletal frame made of steel to make the design fireproof. The building was leased by Levi Leiter to the department store of Siegel, Cooper and Company who occupied it for approximately seven years. After Siegel Cooper closed, the building hosted various tenants until it became the downtown flagship store of Sears, Roebuck and Company in 1931.  Sears occupied the space the until 1986 when it decided to close the store and the space was leased to other tenants.The structure is eight floors and occupies the entire block of State Street between Ida B. Wells Drive and Van Buren Street. The State Street facade consists of nine bays separated by wide pilasters. The pilasters are capped by simple capitals and an unadorned cornice crowns the entire structure. The Ida B. Wells and Van Buren facades are three bays wide with measurements of 400 ft (120 m) by 143 ft (44 m). Within each bay are four windows on each floor aligned vertically. The building is faced with a pink granite. Each floor contains 50,000 sq ft (4,600 m2) with 16 ft (4.9 m) ceilings and could be divided to house multiple tenants.Its predecessor, the First Leiter Building, was designed by Jenney in 1879 and stood at Wells and Monroe until it was demolished in 1972. The Second Leiter Building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and a Chicago Landmark on January 14, 1997. From 1998 to 2020, the building was home to the Chicago campus of Robert Morris University, which vacated the space following its merger with Roosevelt University on March 9, 2020.",

They raised sugarcane, citrus, and cotton. The large mill (which was steam-driven) ran from 1851 to 1864. It produced sugar, syrup and molasses, the latter used in making rum.

        "long_description": "Fort Astoria (also named Fort George) was the primary fur trading post of John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company (PFC). A maritime contingent of PFC staff was sent on board the Tonquin, while another party traveled overland from St. Louis. This land based group later became known as the Astor Expedition. Built at the entrance of the Columbia River in 1811, Fort Astoria was the first American-owned settlement on the Pacific coast of North America.\nThe inhabitants of the fort differed greatly in background and position, and were structured into a corporate hierarchy. The fur trading partners of the company were at the top, with clerks, craftsmen, hunters, and laborers in descending order. Nationalities included Americans, Scots, French Canadian voyageurs, Native Hawaiian Kanakas, and various indigenous North Americans, including Iroquois and others from Eastern Canada. They found life quite monotonous, with the fish and vegetable diet boring. Venereal diseases were problematic. Types of fur taken in trade at the fort included beaver, sea otter, squirrel, and red fox.\nThe onset of the War of 1812 caused the PFC to fold as it was too isolated to expect any military protection or support from the United States. The Montreal-based North West Company (NWC) bought out the assets of the PFC in 1813, including Fort Astoria. They renamed it Fort George and utilized it as the headquarters of its most western operations, primarily based along the Columbia. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay Company incorporated Fort George into its collection of posts after absorbing the NWC. The opening of Fort Vancouver in 1825 was planned to allow for a better placed headquarters for the Columbia Department. While Fort George was abandoned in 1825, the arrival of American naval merchants on the Columbia necessitated the reopening of Fort George by the HBC.\nCompetition for control of Fort Astoria was a factor in the British and the Americans' resolving their disputed claims to the Oregon Country.The Fort Astoria Site was added to the list of National Historic Landmarks on November 5, 1961. It is marked by a reconstructed block house.\n\n",

In attempting to do this, Spain sought to turn local indigenous tribes into good Spanish citizens (for Mission Santa Barbara, this was the Chumash-Barbare\u00f1o tribe). This required religious conversion and integration into the Spanish colonial economy \u2013 for the local Chumash people, the environmental changes wrought by the Mission's large herd of livestock, combined with epidemics and military force, meant that tribal members often had little choice but to join the mission system, resulting in a type of forced servitude.\nThe mission is the namesake of the city of Santa Barbara as well as of Santa Barbara County and comes from the legend of Saint Barbara, a girl who was beheaded by her father for following the Christian faith.\nThe Mission grounds occupy a rise between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez Mountains, and were consecrated by Father Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n, who had taken over the presidency of the California mission chain upon the death of Father Jun\u00edpero Serra.

The island was long home to an Odawa settlement and previous indigenous cultures before European colonization began in the 17th century.

Because of its historic significance, the entire island is listed as a National Historic Landmark.

It has diameter just over 25 feet (7.6 m) at the base.The tower was deemed historically significant in its NRHP nomination in part as \"a fine example of the type of water tower construction popular in Wisconsin during this period. It is distinctive in its overall height and its intact original steel tank. The tower also has fine brick construction making it a masonry landmark in Fort Atkinson.\"  Also it is significant for representing the creation of a municipal water system, whose development \"was fraught with considerable political debate. For almost 10 years, the issue of a municipal water works was debated and strongly opposed by a vocal minority. When the water works was finally built, it was both a political and historical event. That it happened in 1901, the beginning of a new century, was symbolic in that it was part of the overall growth and development of utilities that dramatically changed the way people in the\ncommunity lived in the twentieth century. The water tower is the largest and most prominent symbol of the development of the Fort Atkinson water works, a symbol of the history of this important public service.\"",

It hosts the Fort Jackson Maritime Museum.\nNamed in honor of James Jackson (1757\u20131806), a British-born political figure in Georgia, Fort Jackson was constructed between 1808 and 1812 to protect the city of Savannah from attack by sea. During the American Civil War, it became one of three Confederate forts that defended Savannah from Union forces (the other two were Fort McAllister and Fort Pulaski). In 1862, Fort Jackson came under shelling from a ship captained by an escaped slave, Robert Smalls.\nWhen the Union army commanded by William T. Sherman captured Savannah by land in December 1864, it took Fort Jackson almost immediately. The fort went by the name of Fort Oglethorpe between 1884 and 1905, and was little used by the U.S. military. It was purchased by the city of Savannah in 1924 for park purposes and was fully restored in the 1970s. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2000.Fort Jackson is located at 1 Fort Jackson Road, on the Islands Expressway linking Savannah to Fort Pulaski and the town of Tybee Island.  Fort Jackson is owned by the state of Georgia and operated as a museum by the Coastal Heritage Society.  In the summer the fort has a daily cannon-firing demonstration.",

While owned by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation the Ellison House is administered and operated by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, like many other state parks and historic sites in the mid and lower Hudson region.\nToday, the house can be toured when the site is open. It is used to educate visitors about how 18th-century families such as the Ellisons actually lived. On holidays and special occasions staff dress in reproduction period clothing and give special events. Staff dressed as the 2nd Continental Artillery frequently demonstrate cannon use on the grounds during special events, as Knox was best known for his command of Continental artillery.\nThe house and its grounds were the setting and subject of the children's haunted-house novel Buried Treasure (1919), by the best-selling children's author Henry Everett McNeil.  The book is illustrated with McNeil's own photographs (made circa 1911 or 1912) of the various buildings and bridge at the Knox site.\nThe Jane Colden Plant Sanctuary along some of the trails in the nearby woods memorializes America's first female botanist, who also resided in the area.\n\n",

The tower is 615 feet (187 m) tall (the equivalent of forty stories), consisting of 34 office stories topped by a pyramidal, gilded six-story roof.

        "long_description": "The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard was the first United States Navy shipyard and was historically important for nearly two centuries.Construction of the original Philadelphia Naval Shipyard began during the American Revolution in 1776 at Front and Federal Streets in what is now the Pennsport section of Philadelphia. In 1871, it was replaced by a new, much larger yard developed around facilities on League Island, at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. The Navy Yard expansion stimulated the development over time of residences and businesses in South Philadelphia, where many shipyard workers lived. During World War II, some 40,000 workers operated on shifts around the clock to produce and repair ships at the yard for the war effort.\nThe U.S. Navy ended most of its activities at the shipyard in the 1990s, closing the base after recommendations by the Base Realignment and Closure commission. In 2000, the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, on behalf of the City of Philadelphia, acquired it and began to redevelop the land. First called Philadelphia Naval Business Center, it is now known as The Navy Yard. It is a large mixed-use campus where nearly 15,000 people are employed by more than 120 companies representing a mix of industries, including cell therapy production facilities, global fashion companies, and a commercial shipyard. The U.S. Navy still operates a Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility and a few engineering activities at the site.",

He joined the Confederate army on July 5, 1861, as a colonel, but was promoted to general the next October. He was placed in charge of the engineering of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, succeeding another general, but was unable to stop the building of the militarily deficient Fort Henry until too late. He was captured at the Battle of Fort Henry, and would not return to duty until the next Fall, which led to his death during the Vicksburg Campaign.In 1909 it was decided to honor Tilghman.  Tilghman's sons Frederick and Sidell and the United Daughters of the Confederacy jointly paid for the building of the monument, with the brothers paying $10,000 and the UDC paying $5,000.The statue was made by Henry Hudson Kitson, then a resident of Boston, Massachusetts who immigrated from England.  The statue depicting Tilghman is made of bronze, and is on top of a pink granite pedestal and base.  The total height is twelve feet.  The two bases are perfect squares of seventeen feet and 25 feet.  The historical marker at the site was placed there by the Augusta Tilghman High School class of 1929.On July 17, 1997, it was one of sixty-one different monuments to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission.  One other monument on the list, the Confederate Monument in Paducah, is nearby.  Tilghman's home in Paducah is also on the National Register, and currently serves as a museum.",

Because of its early importance in these areas, and its influence on the design of later stadiums, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The stadium is the nation's oldest permanent concrete structure dedicated to intercollegiate athletics. It seated up to 57,166 in the past, as permanent steel stands (completing a stadium shape) were installed in the stadium's northeast end zone in 1929. They were torn down after the 1951 season, due to deterioration and reduced attendance. Afterward, there were smaller temporary steel bleachers across the stadium's open end until the building of the Murr Center (which is topped by the new scoreboard) in 1998.\nHarvard Stadium hosted one Boston Patriots season in 1970.

As the first planned scenic roadway in the United States, it has been recognized in numerous ways, including being listed on the National Register of Historic Places, being designated as a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, being designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers, and being considered a \"destination unto itself\" as an All-American Road by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. The historic roadway was bypassed by the present Columbia River Highway No. 2 (Interstate 84) from the 1930s to the 1950s, leaving behind the old two-lane road. The road is now mostly owned and maintained by the state through the Oregon Department of Transportation as the Historic Columbia River Highway No. 100 (still partially marked as U.S. Route 30; see Oregon highways and routes) or the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department as the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail.\nThe original highway was promoted by lawyer and entrepreneur Sam Hill and engineer Samuel C. Lancaster, to be modeled after the great scenic roads of Europe.  From the very beginning, the roadway was envisioned not just as means of traveling by the then popular Model T, but designed with an elegance that took full advantage of all the natural beauty along the route.\nWhen the United States highway system was officially established in 1926, the highway became the part of U.S. Route 30. Since then, modern Interstate 84 has been built parallel to the highway between Portland and The Dalles, replacing it as the main travel route and resulting in the loss of some of the original sections of road.",

The Art Deco building overlooks the National Zoological Park and Klingle Valley Park, which is near the Art Deco Klingle Valley Bridge. The original main building was built between 1930 and 1931 with 210 apartments.\nThe plans of its architect, Joseph Younger, called for a northeast wing and a south wing as well, but construction of these was stopped because of the onset of the Great Depression. The northeast wing was later built in 1935 with 107 additional apartments, as economic conditions improved in Washington. And the B. F. Saul Company, owner of the building since 1935, added the south wing between 2002 and 2004. The architect of the northeast wing was Alexander H. Sonneman, and of the south wing was Hartman-Cox. The current total number of apartments, ranging from efficiencies to three-bedroom units, is 425.\nThe Kennedy\u2013Warren is considered the largest and best example of an Art Deco building in Washington. In 1989, the building was listed as a District of Columbia Historic Landmark, and in 1994 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

        "long_description": "The United States Bullion Depository, often known as Fort Knox, is a fortified vault building located next to the United States Army post of Fort Knox, Kentucky.  It is operated by the United States Department of the Treasury.  The vault is used to store a large portion of the United States' gold reserves as well as other precious items belonging to or in custody of the federal government. It currently holds roughly 147 million troy ounces (4,580 metric tons) of gold bullion, a little over half the total gold presently held by the federal government. The United States Mint Police protects the depository.\nThe Treasury built the depository in 1936 on land transferred to it from the military. Its purpose was to house gold then stored in New York City and Philadelphia, in keeping with a strategy to move gold reserves away from coastal cities to areas less vulnerable to foreign military attack.  The first set of gold shipments to the depository occurred during the first half of 1937. A second set was completed in 1941. These shipments, overseen by the United States Post Office Department, totaled roughly 417 million troy ounces (12,960 metric tons), almost two-thirds of the total gold reserves of the United States.\nDuring World War II the signed original Constitution of the United States, Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address and drafts of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address were stored in its vault for protection, as was a Gutenberg Bible and an exemplified copy of Magna Carta.  After the war, the depository held the Crown of St. Stephen as well as stockpiles of opium and morphine.  Today it is known to hold ten 1933 Double Eagle gold coins, a 1974-D aluminum penny, and twelve gold (22-karat) Sacagawea dollar coins that flew on the Space Shuttle Columbia, specifically STS-93 in 1999.\nThe depository is a secure facility. Between its fenced perimeter and granite-lined concrete structure lie rings of razor wire. The grounds are monitored by high-resolution night vision video cameras and microphones. The subterranean vault is made of steel plates, I-beams and cylinders encased in concrete.  Its torch-and-drill resistant door is 21 inches (53 cm) thick and weighs 20 short tons (18 metric tons). The vault door is set on a 100-hour time lock, and can only be opened by members of the depository staff who must dial separate combinations.  Visitors are not allowed inside.  It is so secure that the term \"as safe as Fort Knox\" has become a clich\u00e9 for safety and security.",

A number of innovations made the canal possible, including hydraulic cement, which was used to mortar its locks, and an ingenious floating towpath to span the Concord River.  The canal operated until 1851, when more efficient means of transportation of bulk goods, largely railroads, meant it was no longer competitive.\nIn 1967, the canal was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Remnants of the canal still survive and were the subject of a 1972 listing on the National Register of Historic Places, while the entire route, including parts that have been overbuilt, is the subject of a second listing in 2009.",

It reflects the tastes of a younger, post-Revolutionary generation of wealthy landowners in the Livingston family who were beginning to be influenced by French trends in home design, moving beyond the strictly English models exemplified by Clermont Manor a short distance up the Hudson River. It is the only Hudson Valley estate house from this era that survives intact, and Davis's only surviving neoclassical country house.Andrew Jackson Downing praised the landscapes of the estate, work he had informally consulted on that was not completed in its final form until almost the mid-20th century. The southern 70 acres (28 ha) of the estate, which he called the Wilderness and is today known as the South Woods, is the oldest oak forest in the Hudson Valley. It has grown to 380 acres (150 ha), and includes many outbuildings. A network of trails and paths connects them and offers both quiet wooded tracts and views of the river and Catskill Mountains.\nThe estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Ten years later, the Livingston descendants sold it to Historic Hudson Valley, a regional historic preservation group. The district was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990, and Montgomery Place received that designation itself in 1992.

The museum is built around a working turntable and a roundhouse that are largely replications of the original DL&W facilities; the roundhouse, for example, was reconstructed from remnants of a 1932 structure. The site also features several original outbuildings dated between 1899 and 1902. All the buildings on the site are listed with the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Yard-Dickson Manufacturing Co. Site.Most of the steam locomotives and other railroad equipment at Steamtown NHS were originally collected by F. Nelson Blount, a millionaire seafood processor from New England.  In 1964, Blount established a non-profit organization, the Steamtown Foundation, to operate Steamtown, U.S.A., a steam railroad museum and excursion business in Bellows Falls, Vermont. In 1984, the foundation moved Steamtown to Scranton, conceived of as urban redevelopment and funded in part by the city. But the museum failed to attract the expected 200,000 to 400,000 annual visitors, and within two years was facing bankruptcy.In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, at the urging of Scranton native Representative Joseph M. McDade, approved $8 million to begin turning the museum into a National Historic Site. The idea was derided by those who called the collection second-rate, the site's historical significance questionable, and the public funding no more than pork-barrel politics.  But proponents said the site and the collection were ideal representations of American industrial history. By 1995, the National Park Service (NPS) had acquired Steamtown, USA, and improved its facilities at a total cost of $66 million.\nSteamtown National Historic Site has since sold a few pieces from the Blount collection, and added a few others deemed of greater historical significance to the region. By 2008, low visitor attendance and the need of costly asbestos removal from many pieces of the collection were spurring discussion about privatizing Steamtown.",

The mine is the largest man-made excavation, and deepest open-pit mine in the world, which is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history \u2013 more than 19,000,000 short tons (17,000,000 long tons; 17,000,000 t). The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group, a British-Australian multinational corporation. The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine, a concentrator plant, a smelter, and a refinery. The mine has been in production since 1906, and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.75 miles (1,210 m) deep, 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, and covering 1,900 acres (3.0 sq mi; 770 ha; 7.7 km2). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine. The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013.",

        "long_description": "The Blythe Intaglios or Blythe Geoglyphs are a group of gigantic figures incised on the ground near Blythe, California, in the Colorado Desert. The ground drawings or geoglyphs were created by humans for an, as yet, unknown reason.\nThe intaglios are located east of the Big Maria Mountains, about 15 miles (24 km) north of downtown Blythe, just west of U.S. Highway 95 near the Colorado River.  The Blythe Intaglios are the most well-known of the over 200 intaglios in the Colorado Desert. The Colorado Desert contains the only known desert intaglios in North America. These intaglios are mostly located along the Colorado River.\nThe Blythe Intaglios contain three human figures, two four-legged animals, and a spiral; although Harner (1953) reported two spirals. The largest human figure in the Blythe Intaglio group is 171 feet (52 m) long. The intaglios are best viewed from the air.\nGeoglyphs are found throughout the world, the construction methods ranging from earthen mounds, piles of stone, or the removal of surface plants or soil. The most famous desert intaglios are the Nazca Lines in Peru. The Blythe Geoglyphs or intaglios (anthropomorphic geoglyphs) were created by scraping away layers of darker rocks or pebbles to reveal a stratum of lighter-valued soil. The displaced rocks outlined the figures and the exposed soil was stamped down which makes it more difficult for plants to grow in the lines. The intaglios are located on flat terraces in the Colorado River floodplain.While these \"gravel pictographs\" are found through the deserts of southeastern California, human figures are found only near the Colorado River. Other intaglios depict mountain lions, birds, snakes and unidentified zoomorphic and geometric shapes. The figures are so immense that many of them were not observed by non-natives until the 1930s.  The set of Blythe Intaglios and nearby geoglyphs include several dozen figures, thought to be ceremonial in nature.No Colorado River Native American group has claimed to have made the intaglios, although some have claimed to use them. Many of the intaglios are believed to date from the prehistoric period, but their age and the identity of their creators are still uncertain. If the quadruped figures represent horses (reintroduced in North America by the Spanish) then a historical date would be supported. Jay von Werlhof and his collaborators obtained 13 AMS radiocarbon dates for the figures, ranging from 900 BCE to 1200 CE.\n\n",

The galleries are open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 4 p.m. on Sundays. Dyche Hall has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since July 14, 1974; it was listed for its connection with Lewis Lindsay Dyche and for its distinctive Romanesque style of architecture. The exterior is constructed of local Oread Limestone, while the window facings, columns, arches, and grotesques are carved from Cottonwood Limestone. Dyche Hall is also the site of one of only three Victory Eagle statues in Kansas, once used as markers on the Victory Highway.\nAmong its more than 350 separate exhibits, the museum is famous for its Panorama of North American Wildlife, part of which represented Kansas in the 1893 World's Colombian Exposition in Chicago, and was the impetus for the funding and construction of Dyche Hall and its Natural History Museum between 1901 and 1903. Modeled after a church in France, Dyche Hall was designed to house the Panorama in the \"apse\" of the entrance gallery. The museum is also renowned for Comanche, the only survivor on the U.S. Cavalry side of the Battle of the Little Bighorn; for its extensive exhibits of plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, pterosaurs, and other fossils from the Kansas Chalk; and most recently for its newest displays of mammalian skulls, the parasites of sharks and rays, and the pre-Columbian archaeology of Costa Rica.\nThe Biodiversity Institute, with more than 10 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, and archaeological artifacts, is one of the world's leaders in collection-based studies of systematics, evolution, phylogenetics, paleobiology, past cultures, biodiversity modeling, and in providing digital access to collection-based biodiversity data biodiversity informatics, including deploying these data for forecasting environmental phenomena. The Institute's collections, faculty-curators, staff and students are housed in six buildings across the KU campus, with the most recent expansion occurring in 2006\u20132007, when the Division of Entomology, along with parts of the ornithological and mammal collection, were moved to a new facility on the university's West Campus.",

Hornet then took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and most of the subsidiary operations, most notably the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June that was nicknamed the \"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\" for the disproportionate losses inflicted upon the Japanese. The ship then participated in the Philippines Campaign in late 1944, and the Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign in the first half of 1945. She was badly damaged by a typhoon in June and had to return to the United States for repairs.\nAfter the war she took part in Operation Magic Carpet, returning troops to the U.S. and was then placed in reserve in 1946. Hornet was reactivated during the Korean War of 1950\u20131953, but spent the rest of the war being modernized to allow her to operate jet-propelled aircraft. The ship was modernized again in the late 1950s for service as an anti-submarine carrier. She played a minor role in the Vietnam War during the 1960s and in the Apollo program, recovering the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 astronauts when they returned from the Moon.\nHornet was decommissioned in 1970.

The 67-acre (27 ha) park is situated on a ridge in Upper Manhattan, close to the Hudson River to the west. It extends mostly from 192nd Street in the south to Riverside Drive in the north, and from Broadway in the east to the Henry Hudson Parkway in the west. The main entrance to the park is at Margaret Corbin Circle, at the intersection of Fort Washington Avenue and Cabrini Boulevard.\nThe area was known by the local Lenape tribe as Chquaesgeck and by Dutch settlers as Lange Bergh (Long Hill). During the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Fort Washington was fought at the site of the park on November 16, 1776. The area remained sparsely populated during the 19th century, but by the turn of the 20th century, it was the location of large country estates.\nBeginning in January 1917, philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., bought up the \"Tryon Hall\" estate of Chicago industrialist C. K. G. Billings and several others to create Fort Tryon Park.  He engaged the Olmsted Brothers firm to design the park and hired James W. Dawson to create the planting plan. Rockefeller gave the land to the city in 1931, after two prior attempts to do so were unsuccessful, and the park was completed in 1935. Rockefeller also bought sculptor George Gray Barnard's collection of medieval art and gave it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which from 1935 to 1939 built the Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park to house the collection.\nThe park is built on a high formation of Manhattan schist with igneous intrusions and glacial striations from the last ice age. The park's design included extensive plantings of various flora in the park's many gardens, including the Heather Garden, which was restored in the 1980s. Besides the gardens and the Cloisters, the park has extensive walking paths and meadows, with views of the Hudson and Harlem Rivers. Fort Tryon Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 19, 1978 and was designated a New York City Scenic Landmark in 1983.",

        "long_description": "The Ipiutak site is a large archaeological site at Point Hope in northwest Alaska, United States. It is one of the most important discoveries in this area, competing only with Ekven, Russia.\nIt is the type site for the Ipiutak culture, which arose possibly as early as 100\u2013200 BCE and collapsed around 800 CE.  The Ipiutak culture occurred from south of the Bering Strait, across the Brooks Range and possibly as far north as Point Barrow.\nThe Ipiutak site was discovered in 1939 by archaeologists Helge Larsen and Froelich Rainey, who completed a monograph on the site in 1948.  The site consists of nearly 600 abandoned house depressions along four beach ridges that impart a linearity that was originally interpreted as purposeful design as roads or \"avenues.\"  Many of the houses are too close to be contemporaneous and the range of several radiocarbon ages suggests a duration of 300\u2013400 years to build all of the houses.   Archaeologists have modeled the population history of the site to infer that only about 125\u2013200 people lived at the site during any one generation and occupied 20 to 30 houses.  The original population estimates of over 4000 are in error.\nExcavations in 1940 and 1941 produced sizable collections from 74 square driftwood constructed houses and over 120 burials, now archived within three museums: the National Museum of Denmark, the American Museum of Natural History and the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\nThe site is renowned for its mortuary offerings, one of which is termed a \"mask.\"  One Point Hope Ipiutak mask represents a human face with a gaping mouth and blowfly larvae issuing from its nostrils; a symbol pregnant with shamanistic meaning. A very similar \"maskoid\" is reported from Deering, that is dated between 600 and 800 CE. A variety of open work ivory carvings, engraved with iron burins, are renowned for their figurative representations that include polar bears, loons, seals, and (rarely) humans.  Ipiutak houses contain evidence of military and craft specialization in working walrus tusk, while a number of graves show evidence of violence associated with warfare.\nTwo technological hallmarks of Ipiutak culture are its very finely crafted stone tools used in arrow points and its lack of ceramics. The Ipiutak culture is defined by a distinctive linear, circle and dot aesthetic, that closely resembles the Old Bering Sea culture, which is restricted to Bering Strait and adjacent Siberia.  Ipiutak is contemporaneous with the later phases of Old Bering Sea and very likely had had political, economic and social ties with it.   The original excavators, Larsen and Rainey, linked the Ipiutak open work animal carving style with the distant and Scthyo-Siberian cultures of the Ukraine, but little data support this supposition.  Instead, Ipiutak closely resembles the widespread pan Alaska Norton culture, which did use ceramics and relied on salmon fishing.   The subsistence basis of Ipiutak was sea mammal hunting, most importantly of ringed seal and walrus, although caribou hunting was also crucial.\nThe site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.Several other sites have also been linked to Ipiutak: at Cape Krusenstern, Itivlik Lake, Hahanudan Lake, Feniak Lake, Onion Portage Archeological District, and Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska. The culture is noted for the elaborateness of its artwork, which seems to be an ancestor of Inuit art. It is still unclear why the Ipiutak apparently did not hunt whale or make pottery, considering that they lived in highly developed settlements.",

It combines features of Eastern European synagogues, reflecting the national origin of its founding Ashkenazi Jews, with some elements of historic Protestant Christian churches found in the area. Some features were also adapted from other contemporary synagogues in Sullivan County.After a period of decline in the decades after World War II, following the demise of the local resort industry in the Catskills as people went further for vacations, Agudas Achim officially became a Reform congregation to attract new members. It holds services year-round. The building remains architecturally intact from the period of its construction. In 1998 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe synagogue is located a few blocks from downtown Livingston Manor on the west side of Rock Avenue, the former route of state highway NY 17.

It sits on the northeast corner of Riverside Drive and West 103rd Street. Designed by Harvey Wiley Corbett of the firm Helmle, Corbett & Harrison, in conjunction with Sugarman & Berger, the Master Apartments was completed in 1929 as the tallest building on Riverside Drive. It was the first skyscraper in New York City to feature corner windows and the first to employ brick in varying colors for its entire exterior.\nThe Master Apartments' name derives from the Master Institute of United Arts, an art institute founded in 1920 by Nicholas and Helena Roerich. Wealthy financier Louis L. Horch began purchasing lots in 1925 to build the apartment building, and in 1928 he secured a bond to fund its construction. As built, the building's lower floors consisted of a museum; a school for the fine and performing arts; and an international art center. The building opened in 1929 to generally positive acclaim, but it went into foreclosure in 1932, and Horch's tax-exempt corporation acted as the Master Building's receiver from 1934 to 1935. Following a disagreement between Horch and the Roeriches, the museum was closed and the Roeriches unsuccessfully sued to regain control of the Master Apartments. Louis Horch's wife Nettie also controlled some aspects of the building and its organizations during this time, but by 1958, the Horches' son Frank became the building's manager.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, people moved out of the surrounding Manhattan Valley neighborhood. Consequently, the Master Apartments' museum and cultural center closed by 1971, their holdings dispersed elsewhere, although the building's auditorium was still used for cultural events. After Louis's death in 1979, the building was bought by real estate investor Sol Goldman, who converted it to a housing co-operative over the next decade. Further renovations, which were completed in 2005, resulted in many of the one-bedroom studios being combined into two- and three-bedroom units. These renovations attracted more families and made the building more luxurious by both quality-of-life and purchase-price measures. The Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.",

The 40 surviving milestones were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Massachusetts has a total of 129 surviving milestones including those along the upper Post Road. The stones are so named, despite having been placed in many different years, because of a 1767 directive of the Province of Massachusetts Bay that such stones be placed along major roadways. The state highway department was directed in 1960 to undertake their preservation. Many of them underwent a major restoration in 2018.The first stone was erected by Paul Dudley, one of the prominent citizens of early 18th century Massachusetts, in Roxbury, which was at the time a separate community. Roxbury was located at the end of the Boston Neck, a narrow isthmus separating the mainland from the Shawmut Peninsula, where Boston was located. Travelers going by land from Boston to other areas had to travel over the neck and through Roxbury to reach their destinations. The Roxbury junction where Dudley placed the first stone was where several routes branched, heading south and west across New England.\nDudley erected several stones along the road from Boston to Cambridge which wound its way from Beacon Hill along what is now Washington Street through the Dudley Square area to what is now Huntington Avenue, then along Harvard Street through Brookline Village, Coolidge Corner, and Allston crossing into Cambridge at the Great Bridge, where modern JFK Street in Cambridge becomes North Harvard Street in Allston. The stones that Dudley erected have the initials PD on them, usually at the bottom of the stone. The most chatty of these milestones (not part of this collection), is inscribed P Dudley rather than PD, and is located on the corner of Centre and South Streets in Jamaica Plain.\nThe stones listed for miles 23 through 29 in Wayland and Sudbury are actually guideposts rather than milestones, and do not list any mileage. They were erected at road intersections rather than at the mile marks. The stones are quarried granite posts with plug & feather tool marks and post-date 1800.",

Eventually, the university abandoned the plans to convert the armory into its primary arena, and instead focused on renovating the current arena, the Daskalakis Athletic Center.  However, smaller scale renovations were completed at the armory and it is currently used for many events such as concerts, food events, art gatherings, and conventions.",

Built by John Jacob Astor IV, the hostelry was designed in 1901 and opened in 1906. Its location near the Theater District around Times Square was intended to attract not only residential guests but also theater visitors.\nThe Knickerbocker Hotel is largely designed in the Beaux-Arts style by Marvin & Davis, with Bruce Price as consultant. Its primary frontages are on Broadway and 42nd Street. These facades are constructed of red brick with terracotta details and a prominent mansard roof. The Knickerbocker Hotel also incorporates an annex on 41st Street, built in 1894 as part of the St. Cloud Hotel, which formerly occupied the site. The 41st Street facade contains a Romanesque Revival design by Philip C. Brown. Inside, the hotel contains 300 rooms, a restaurant, a coffee shop, and a roof bar. The original interior  design was devised in 1905 by Trowbridge & Livingston. There are scattered remnants of the original interior design, including an entrance that formerly led from the New York City Subway's Times Square station to the hotel's basement.\nThe original hotel, which served as the home of Enrico Caruso and George M. Cohan, shuttered in 1920 following a decrease in business. The building was then converted to offices, becoming known as the Knickerbocker Building. It was the home of Newsweek magazine from 1940 to 1959 during which it was called the Newsweek Building. After major renovations in 1980, it became known as 1466 Broadway and was used as garment showrooms and offices. Following another renovation in 2001, it was known as 6 Times Square. The Knickerbocker was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1988. It was converted back to a hotel from 2013 to 2015 under its original name.\n\n",

Detmer was a leading member of the firm of Warburg and Company, which was located at Sixth and Main Streets downtown; it did business as a \"merchant tailor\", serving high-end buyers of custom clothing.  Detmer had the house built in 1885, choosing leading Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford to produce the design; Hannaford had become prominent because of his design for Music Hall in the 1870s, and by 1885 he was approaching the end of his time in independent practice.:\u200a11\u200aDetmer's house is a brick building constructed on a stone foundation.  Rather than exemplifying a single architectural style, the house is eclectic.  Among its prominent components are a trio of parapets mixing the roles of gables and dormer windows, constructed in a Flemish Revival style; a porch with Doric columns underneath a pediment, constructed around the main entrance; and numerous corbelled chimneys.  Two bays wide, the facade includes stringcourses of limestone as part of its Flemish Revival parapet, along with small finials; together with the chimneys and the steep hip roof, the parapets help to lend the house the appearance of height greater than its actual two and a half stories.In 1980, the A.M. Detmer House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it qualified for inclusion due to its well-preserved historic architecture.  Nearly 40 other properties in Cincinnati and other parts of Hamilton County, including 14 other houses, were added to the Register at the same time as part of a multiple property submission of buildings designed by Samuel Hannaford and/or his sons.  The Detmer House is significantly newer than some of the houses included in this group, for the oldest of Hannaford's residential designs in the city was constructed in 1862.:\u200a3\u200a",

Its 65 acres (26 ha) encompass the historic center of Wilbraham, as well as the historic central portion of the campus of the Wilbraham & Monson Academy.  It includes properties on Mountain Road (roughly the southern boundary of the district), Main Street, and Faculty Street.  Wesleyan Academy was founded in 1817 and moved to Wilbraham in 1824; its oldest buildings date to 1825.  It merged with Monson Academy in the 20th century to form the present school that occupies the academic premises.  The academy was a major center of Methodist teaching in New England, and was a prominent factor in the town's growth.The main historic building of the academy is called the Old Academy, and is a large brick Federalist building designed by Enoch Mudge in 1825.  It is a two-story building with a slate roof and a white clapboard belltower.  Next to it is Fisk Hall, an 1851 two story building made of brick with sandstone trim; it is topped by a cupola.  Binney Hall, built in 1854, is similarly a two-story brick building.  The Smith Hall Gymnasium was built in 1896, and has Richardsonian Romanesque details and a hipped slate roof.  The Alumni Memorial Chapel stands next to the Gymnasium; it was built in 1867 of red sandstone.In addition to the academy buildings, the district includes a number of civic and residential buildings, including the Old Meetinghouse (built 1793), which was originally designed as a meeting hall, but was converted in 1835 into a residential duplex.  Adjacent to the Old Meetinghouse, is the Hearse House, an outbuilding that housed the town's hearses from 1890 to 1920.  The district also includes a number of residences built mostly in the middle of the 19th century.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.",

It is a few blocks from US 9, just northeast of Springside, Matthew Vassar's never-completed estate that is now a National Historic Landmark.\nIts 140 acres (56 ha) contain 46 buildings, mostly houses, in a variety of 19th and early 20th-century architectural styles. It was the first planned neighborhood in the city.Originally part of Bronson Smith's 1805 farm, the land today part of the district was sold to a group of speculators in 1836. While the financial crisis that ensued the following year set back home construction, later on in the 19th century the purchase proved fruitful as many, many homes were built on it in a mix of styles, with houses near the north end of the district, closer to downtown Poughkeepsie, having smaller lots and yards than the ones further away. Christ Church, also built during this time, remains largely unaltered and is considered a contributing property.In the late 1970s, 85% of the residents voted in favor of establishing the district, after seeing how successful the nearby Garfield Place Historic District had been at enhancing property values and preserving that neighborhood's historic character. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The district designation has spurred the redevelopment and restoration of homes within and has been used as a selling point by real estate agents.Today it is one of three historic districts recognized under city zoning and subject to special architectural rules enforced by the city's Historic District and Landmark Preservation Commission (HDLPC). The HDLPC's jurisdiction over the district is not supreme; in 1986 the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ruled that the city's Planning Board was to be lead agency and have primary jurisdiction over a proposed 18-unit condominium complex within the district.Notable former residents include William Allen Adriance (154 Academy St), farming equipment manufacturer, father of actress Jan Sterling, and founder of Adriance Memorial Library, the main public library in Poughkeepsie.",

        "long_description": "The National Zoological Park, commonly known as the National Zoo, is one of the oldest zoos in the United States. The zoo is part of the Smithsonian Institution and does not charge admission. Founded in 1889, its mission is to \"provide engaging experiences with animals and create and share knowledge to save wildlife and habitats\".The National Zoo has two campuses. The first is a 163-acre (66 ha) urban park located at Rock Creek Park in Northwest Washington, D.C., 20 minutes from the National Mall by MetroRail. The other campus is the 3,200-acre (1,300 ha) Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI; formerly known as the Conservation and Research Center) in Front Royal, Virginia. On this land, there are 180 species of trees, 850 species of woody shrubs and herbaceous plants, 40 species of grasses, and 36 different species of bamboo. The SCBI is a non-public facility devoted to training wildlife professionals in conservation biology and to propagating rare species through natural means and assisted reproduction. The National Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).\nThe two facilities host about 2,700 animals of 390 different species. About one-fifth of them are endangered or threatened. Most species are on exhibit at the Rock Creek Park campus. The zoo is home to birds, great apes, big cats, Asian elephants, insects, amphibians, reptiles, aquatic animals, small mammals and many more, but the best-known residents were giant pandas. The SCBI facility houses between 30 and 40 endangered species at any given time depending on research needs and recommendations from the zoo and the conservation community. The zoo was one of the first to establish a scientific research program. Because it is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Zoo receives federal appropriations for operating expenses. A new master plan for the park was introduced in 2008 to upgrade the park's exhibits and layout.\nThe National Zoo is open every day of the year except for December 25 (Christmas Day), though it was closed for a long period during the COVID-19 pandemic. The zoo reopened following this on May 21, 2021.\n\n",

Lloyd Tilghman, representative of the New Orleans & Ohio Railroad, established the first seven miles of track for Paducah, connecting the town to Florence Station, Kentucky.The freight house was constructed in 1925 by the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway in hopes of future connections with other railroads, such as the Big Four Railroad.  As such, it was built larger than it needed to be, as those connections were never built.  The station was usually used to transport fruits and vegetables that required refrigeration from trains to the private transportation of produce dealers.  The Railway was absorbed into the Louisville & Nashville Railroad in 1957.  In 1974 the L&N reduced their presence in Paducah and moved their workers to a different depot at 6th and Norton in Paducah.  The Johnston-Backus Brokerage Company purchased the building in November 1976.  In 1993 Johnston and Backus retired, selling it to Charles and Carolyn Simpson, who made it an antique mall.The Freight House is a two-story brick structure with a limestone foundation.  It has a Tudor look with its Palladian-type windows and parapeted dormers and end walls.  Its different colored bricks detail the openings of the building.The Paducah Railroad Museum is next door.  It started on the second floor of the freight house, but once the freight house was sold the museum moved to Washington and 2nd streets.",

This YMCA facility served as an important social center within the Black Metropolis area, and it also provided housing and job training for African Americans migrating into Chicago in the early 20th century.  In 1915, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, one of the first groups specializing in African-American studies, was founded during a meeting at the Wabash 'Y'.Louis Gregory, a traveling speaker for the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and often attending national conventions of the religion held in Chicago area, is known to have stayed there in the spring of 1918 and gave talks to clubs while in town. Black contralto Marian Anderson gave one of her early performances here in 1919.The Black Metropolis area in Chicago, centered on the area of 35th Street and State Street, was a city within a city developed by the black community as an alternative to the restrictions, exploitations, and indifference of the city at large.  Wabash Avenue YMCA was opened in 1914, supported by Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears, Roebuck and Company at the time.  Rosenwald had a philanthropic interest in black-oriented causes. YMCA provided job training programs such as auto repair and manual training.  The Black Metropolis district thrived through the 1920s, but competition from white-owned businesses on 47th Street and the effects of the Great Depression led to the closure of many of the black-owned businesses.  Declining membership and deterioration of the building led to its closing in 1981. In the late 1990s, however, a nine-million dollar renovation project was undertaken by TRC to return to the building to its rightful condition.It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1986.",

It was designed by architect Eugene John Stern in the Italian-Spanish Revival style.  The two main wings are eight stories each, and extend out towards Scott Street. These two wings are connected across the back by a ten-story cross section. Decorated stone pediments extend above the roof line in the center of each wing. The cloister type porch graces the main entries which are flanked by triple arched leaded-glass windows.  Above the entries are terra cotta medallions featuring heraldic shields with the initials \"AP\".  The elaborate decor includes detailed stenciling, leaded and stained glass windows, extensive decorative tile, iron work, and ornate light fixtures.  The coffered ceiling in the two story main lobby is overlooked by an open mezzanine floor that contains fine antique furnishings, including a custom made Hazelton Bros. grand piano, designed to match the building's interior structural features.\nThe hotel is named after one of Arkansas' leading historical figures, Albert Pike, a teacher, attorney, newspaperman, Confederate Brigadier General, and later a judge of the Arkansas Supreme Court.  Pike was also a prominent member of the Freemasons, and his writings were officially embraced by the Scottish Rite appendant branch of that fraternity throughout much of the U.S. The building was a hotel from its construction in 1928 (opening in 1929) until December 1971, when the Second Baptist Church assumed ownership and began its Albert Pike Residence Hotel ministry. The purpose was to provide a family retirement community that was happy and uplifting.\nIn 1976 the hotel secured a Section 231 loan for $2,400,000 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This made possible the renovation of the hotel infrastructure bringing it up to current fire and safety standards.\nThe Albert Pike Hotel was entered into the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior in 1978. A grant from the Historical Preservation Society helped to restore the public and community areas to their original condition.\nIn late 1985, the hotel was purchased by a privately held corporation in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Since that time continuous upgrades, such as the addition of kitchen facilities, were made in efficiency, one, and two bedroom apartments. The apartments were created where two hotel rooms had connecting doors. Non connecting rooms are studio apartments with microwave-refrigerator combo units.\nThe North Lounge was restored in 1994 and was made a smoke-free environment. It provides a common activities room, television lounge, post office boxes, and library. Regular events are held to inform residents of health and community services available in the area, as well as weekly bingo, monthly birthday parties, and special occasion and holiday parties.",

The house is associated with Alexander Clark (1826\u20131891), an African American civil rights pioneer and US Minister to Liberia. Clark was a 19th-century abolitionist who made his home in Muscatine for most of his adult life. He fought and won for the integration of public schools in Iowa when his daughter was forbidden to attend her neighborhood school. The case went to the Iowa Supreme Court, which resulted in the integration of all schools in the state. He was an associate of Frederick Douglass, helped to establish Iowa's only Colored regiment during the American Civil War, and the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Muscatine. Clark was named the Minister to Liberia in 1890 by President Benjamin Harrison, where he died a year later. The house was built in 1879 after a fire destroyed Clark's previous house. It was moved 200 feet (61 m) from its original location in 1975, The house was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

The current meeting house was the third they built; fire destroyed both predecessors. Not only is it one of the most well-preserved and intact in the county, it is a rare surviving meeting house built by a Hicksite meeting during that schism in American Quakerism.\nArchitecturally the meeting house shows some signs of Greek Revival influence, also unusual for Quaker buildings. The addition of a porch later in the 19th century also brought in some Victorian touches, again unusual. Its interior was renovated and the building resided when meetings were revived after a brief period of dormancy. However, many of its original furnishings remain.\nTaking up most of the property is the meeting's cemetery, which contains many graves of its members from the earlier years, along with that of Robert Capa, the accomplished mid-century war photographer, and his brother Cornell, although neither were members of the meeting, much less Quakers. The headstones of those graves strongly reflect Quaker burial practices, and thus the cemetery is included in the listing as a contributing resource. An architecturally sympathetic First Day School building added when meetings resumed in the 1970s is non-contributing due to its newness.",

It is on the slopes of Storm King Mountain, near Storm King School. Barr, the most published American female writer born in the 19th century, lived here during the most prolific and successful period of her career.\nBarr, an Englishwoman who came to the United States from Lancashire at the age of 19, moved to New York City in the early 1870s with her daughters from Galveston, Texas, after her husband and six of her nine children died of yellow fever. There she began to write fiction. In 1885, she and her daughters began spending summers at a boardinghouse in Cornwall. Her novels eventually became successful enough that, in 1891, she could afford to buy the cottage, previously rented by artist Abbot Handerson Thayer. After highly regarded local builders Mead and Taft renovated it extensively, she renamed it Cherry Croft, and accordingly most of her work from that time period came to be known as the Cherry Croft novels. She summered there until selling it in 1915, when she moved to White Plains to be cared for by her daughter Lilly.\nMead and White's renovations resulted in a 3,500-square foot (315 m2) three-storey home with six bedrooms, four bathrooms, library, living room and dining room. It has a 1,000-square foot (90 m2) wraparound porch. Barr had a turreted writing room added on upstairs for her use. The original fixtures and trim, including the window screens, are still in place. In 1982, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nIt has been repainted in white and black from the brown with red trim Barr favored. After continuous occupation since Barr's day, in April 2006 it became vacant, and remains so, although work is actively being done on the house as of 2007.",

David Ames, Jr., a Springfield paper manufacturer, was the son of Colonel David Ames, the first superintendent of the Springfield Armory. The David Ames Jr. House, at 241 Maple Street, on Ames Hill in Springfield, was built in 1826-7 and was the work of Chauncey Shepard, a prominent local architect and builder. In 1867, Solomon J. Gordon, a New York City lawyer, purchased the property and Shepard was hired to remodel the house he had built forty-one years earlier. Gordon lived in the house until his death in 1891. Today the house is known as Young House and is part of the campus of the MacDuffie School.Crescent Hill continues along the steep trajectory of Maple Street, which snakes up along a bluff overlooking the scenic Connecticut River and Connecticut River Valley. Crescent Hill also features many of Springfield's largest mansions, most of which date from the mid-19th century.

The mill gets its current name from James \u201cTyger Jim\" Anderson who acquired the mill in 1831. The site of the establishment of Spartanburg County in a court held in the Spartanburg District on the third Monday in June 1785. The mill is important to Spartanburg's local history.\nAnderson Mill is located adjacent to a set of rapids with significant drop and is supplied by a millpond created by a diversion wall with a stone and wooden flume leading to the waterwheel.\nThe original facility is believed to have been built about the time of the American Revolution. There was a major rebuilding process after the mill was heavily damaged by floods in the early 1900's. The Mill is the oldest mill in South Carolina still standing on its original foundation.

The growth of this village contributed to the decision in the 19th century to separate the more rural area of North Andover from the town.  It is centered on a stretch of the Shawsheen River between North Main Street on the east and Moraine Street on the west.  Most of the district's properties lie on Stevens Street, Red Spring Road, Shawsheen Road, and Essex Street, with a few properties also located on adjacent roads.Although no buildings remain from Andover's earliest industrial enterprises in the area, there are still some mill buildings that date as far back as to the 1820s in the old Marland Mill complex on Stevens Street.  The most prominent building in this complex, however, is a spinning and carding mill that was built in 1885, and features a five-story tower and ornate brick detailing.One of the older buildings in the district was the Abbot Mills complex, with history dating to 1814. Located at 18-20 Red Spring Road, it was a 3+1\u20442-story wood-frame barn-like structure. It was next door to the mills of Smith & Dove, which are of stone construction dating to the 1820s. The other major industrial component of the district is the Tyer Rubber complex on Railroad Street, whose main building dates to 1912. The barn-like structure of the Abbot Mills complex suffered a fire in 2013  and was demolished in 2014. Much of the wood in the building was salvaged and recycled.There is a significant variety in the types of housing related to the mills.  Much of the early housing has Greek Revival styling, although there are a few houses that show more Federal style detailing.  Later housing includes boarding houses, tenements, and other multiunit buildings in a diversity of styles.The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.",

Also in 1891, Graf received one of the area's earliest federal land patents for his homestead. Graf worked as a farmer and machinist, and as a homebuilder in Portland and Corbett.

The house is richly decorated with stone carvings according to White's tastes, intended to remind students of men's accomplishments and inspire them to higher purpose and an appreciation of beauty. White left the house to the university for the perpetual use of its later presidents. Presidents still use the study on the southeast side of the building as a private office/retreat.\nIn 1953, the house was renovated for use as the University Art Museum, and its carriage house converted into what is now the Big Red Barn, a graduate student lounge. It served in this role until 1973, and was considered for demolition. Henry Guerlac, Director of the university's Society for the Humanities, led the cause to prevent its destruction and have it placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The house library is now called the Guerlac Room in his honor. Since the construction of a new Johnson museum, the house has been used for offices of the Humanities Society.",

Originally built as a social club for Ponce's elite, it is currently used as the premier reception center of \"The Noble City of Puerto Rico\". The building, designed by Agustin Camilo Gonzalez in the Second Empire and Neo-Rococo styles, has a French facade and tones. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 28 October 1987. It is located at the corner of Marina and Luna streets. The building has been called \"an icon of Ponce's architecture, history, and identity.\" It is owned and administered by the Ponce Municipal Government. In 1936, during the Great Depression, the Casino declared bankruptcy and shut down. It subsequently had various uses: a postal office, a public health unit, tax collector's office, and even a temporary city hall. In 1990 it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government, and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His Majesty Felipe de Borbon, took place.",

In 1979 its easternmost third, the Ten Broeck Triangle, the second oldest residential neighborhood in the city, was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Four years later, the district was increased to its current size and renamed to reflect its expansion to include some of the rest of Arbor Hill.The future district was first established by its oldest contributing property, the Ten Broeck Mansion, built at the end of the 18th century by a prominent local family. It lent its name to the Ten Broeck Triangle, established in the middle of the following century when successful businessmen, primarily lumber dealers, built large houses along Ten Broeck Avenue with the fortunes they had made from trade on the Erie Canal. It was one of the first neighborhoods to develop north of the city's downtown as it grew during the 19th century.\nIts fortunes began to slip as the city expanded westward to new neighborhoods like Washington Park which attracted the city's affluent. As the 20th century began, it gradually became a more middle-class neighborhood, then, after the Great Migration, predominantly African American. As an effective racial ghetto, the neighborhood and its historic buildings suffered the effects of disinvestment and decline. The designation of the historic district, and other efforts by preservationists later in the century, have begun to reverse that trend. In the late 2010s Albany mayor Kathy Sheehan and her husband bought and rehabilitated one of the district's vacant townhouses to make their home.\nOver 200 buildings, mostly a mix of rowhouses and detached houses built between the 1840s and 1870s, are listed as contributing properties. The largest, the Ten Broeck Mansion, is also the only property in the district listed on the Register individually. The district also includes two churches, including St. Joseph's Church, reflecting a later popularity with immigrants.",

A second level was incorporated for use as a community gathering place. The town of Arcadia developed and prospered with the arrival of the railroad and in the 1920s the newly commissioned Route 66 was aligned through the town, passing next to the Round Barn.\nWith the reduction of traffic along Route 66 following the arrival of the Interstate, Arcadia and the barn likewise declined. In 1988 the 60 foot diameter roof collapsed. A team of volunteers led by Luther Robison worked to rebuild the structure, and restoration work was completed in 1992. Today the old barn is a tourist attraction and visitors admire the architectural and engineering details of America's only truly round (as opposed to hexagonal or octagonal) barn.",

The building was enlarged in 1810\u201311, with the addition of the west wing.  Architects Walter Ferris Price and Morris & Erskine also contributed to the design and construction of the building.  The firm Cope & Lippincott renovated the interior of the east wing and designed the two-story addition behind the center building in 1968\u201369.Today, the Meeting House continues to be a center for worship and the activities of the Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia and Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.\nNotable members of the Religious Society of Friends who worshiped at this meetinghouse include abolitionists and woman rights advocates, Sarah and Angelina Grimke. Edward Hicks, the noted painter and cousin of Elias Hicks, also attended meeting here.The meetinghouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 2011.  The latter designation was as a consequence of the building being the only surviving documented work by Owen Biddle.",

Composed of houses constructed around the turn of the twentieth century, it has been one of the neighborhood's most important streets since it was established, and it was designated a historic district in 1987.\nWhen the Village of Brooklyn was first platted, Archwood Avenue (originally Greenwood St) was included as one of the village's side streets.  Lots along Archwood were larger than those along other streets, and the street itself was atypically wide, so the village's largest original houses were built along the street.  The Village of Brooklyn was annexed as Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood in 1894, Archwood retained its significant place in the neighborhood.  The street's built environment is variable: late nineteenth-century styles such as Colonial Revival, Italianate, and Queen Anne are all found in the district.Rather than being concentrated in separate pockets, the styles are mixed together: in one block, a two-story Italianate house is placed between a two-story Queen Anne and a three-story Queen Anne on a corner lot.  Five of the neighborhood's residences, known as the William Coates, Weldon Davis, Oscar Kroehle, Adam Poe, and Charles Selzer Houses, are the premier buildings within the district, while a pair of apartment buildings at the 33rd Street intersection are distinguished by two separate facades with ornamental entrances.In 1987, Archwood Avenue was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, due to the integrity of its historic architecture.  Covering 13 acres (5.3 ha), the district includes 57 different buildings, all of which qualified for consideration as contributing properties.",

With an area of 526 acres (213 ha), Prospect Park is the second-largest public park in Brooklyn, behind Marine Park. Designated as a New York City scenic landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Prospect Park is operated by the Prospect Park Alliance and NYC Parks.\nFirst proposed in legislation passed in 1859, Prospect Park was laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who also helped design Manhattan's Central Park, following various changes to its design. Prospect Park opened in 1867, though it was not substantially complete until 1873. The park subsequently underwent numerous modifications and expansions to its facilities. Several additions to the park were completed in the 1890s, in the City Beautiful architectural movement. In the early 20th century, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up Prospect Park. A period of decline in the late 20th century spurred the creation of the Prospect Park Alliance, which refurbished many parts of the park from the 1980s through the 2020s.\nMain attractions of the park include the 90-acre (36 ha) Long Meadow; the Picnic House; Litchfield Villa; Prospect Park Zoo; the Boathouse; Concert Grove; Brooklyn's only lake, covering 60 acres (24 ha); and the Prospect Park Bandshell that hosts outdoor concerts in the summertime. The park also has sports facilities, including the Prospect Park Tennis Center, basketball courts, baseball fields, soccer fields, and the New York P\u00e9tanque Club in the Parade Ground. There is also a private Society of Friends (Quaker) cemetery on Quaker Hill near the ball fields. In addition, Prospect Park is part of the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway, a network of green spaces that stretch across western Long Island.",

The facade and part of the interior are New York City designated landmarks, and the building is listed on both the New York State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a National Historic Landmark. It is also a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, listed on the NRHP.\n55 Wall Street's granite facade includes two stacked colonnades facing Wall Street, each with twelve columns. Inside is a cruciform banking hall with a 60-foot (18 m) vaulted ceiling, Corinthian columns, marble floors and walls, and an entablature around the interior. The banking hall was among the largest in the United States when it was completed.

The tower, in the city's Pioneer Park, was built between 1932 and 1933 using Lillie Hitchcock Coit's bequest to beautify the city of San Francisco. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 29, 2008.The Art Deco tower, built of unpainted reinforced concrete, was designed by architects Arthur Brown Jr. and Henry Temple Howard. The interior features fresco murals in the American Social Realism style, painted by 25 different onsite artists and their numerous assistants, plus two additional paintings installed after creation offsite.\nThe structure was dedicated to the volunteer firemen who had died in San Francisco's five major fires. A concrete relief of a phoenix by sculptor Robert Boardman Howard is placed above the main entrance. It was commissioned by the architect and cast as part of the building.Although an apocryphal story claims that the tower was designed to resemble a fire hose nozzle due to Coit's affinity with the San Francisco firefighters of the day, the resemblance is coincidental.\n\n",

        "long_description": "Antwerp station is a historic former train station in the village of Antwerp in the far western portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Built in 1880 by the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway, it is a primarily wooden structure with weatherboarded walls.  Its roof features a distinctively large overhang.When the depot was built, Antwerp was the largest community in Paulding County, due to an active logging industry.  Accordingly, the depot was built to be larger than most train stations in small northwestern Ohio communities.  Inside, the station is divided into several distinct areas: freight, ordinary passengers, mail and express packaging, and internal railroad offices; each possess their own rooms.  Other than its size, the depot is typical of late nineteenth-century train stations in northwestern Ohio, which frequently served as commercial hubs for their communities.After the station closed in 1976, the Antwerp Historical Society purchased it from the Norfolk and Western Railway; having no use for the station, the railroad asked the society to relocate it, and the depot was moved to its present location, approximately 200 feet (61 m) to the west of its original site.  Four years later, the depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Antwerp Norfolk and Western Depot, both because of its distinctive architecture and because of its significance in local history.  This designation is unusual, for buildings that have been moved from their original locations are not normally eligible for inclusion on the National Register.",

Located along the Porters Creek Trail in the Greenbrier valley, it was constructed in 1875 by Pinkney Whaley. The Whaleys later sold their farm to John H. Messer, who was married to Pinkney's cousin, Lucy.  \nIn the 1930s, the Smoky Mountain Hiking Club, which constructed the Smoky Mountain Hiking Club Cabin nearby, leased the barn from the National Park Service.  The barn was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and is the last surviving structure from the pre-park Greenbrier Cove community. This barn should not be confused with the Messer Barn in Cataloochee, which was built by John's cousin, Will Messer.\nThe Messer Barn is a type of double-cantilever barn unique to East Tennessee and rarely found outside Sevier, Blount, and Cocke counties. The barn is one story with a hayloft, and measures 25 feet (7.6 m) by 45 feet (14 m). The gabled roof, as with all double-cantilevers, has considerable overhang, allowing livestock shelter in inclement weather. Unlike the reconstructed double-cantilever barn at the Tipton Place in Cades Cove, the Messer Barn's overhang is supported by poles along the outer edge.The barn's foundation is dry-stacked field stone and is higher on one end to compensate for the hill slope. The barn interior consists of two pens, each divided into two stalls, with a \"drive-through\" in the middle. While the barn walls are built of wooden boards, the pens are built of hewn logs. The barn's hayloft consists of poles set on two-foot centers.",

The location may have been affected by the development of plant cultivation at the time, and extensive seed deposits at the site provide insight into developing agricultural practices. In addition, preserved remnants of woven artifacts have been found at the site; such items are rare and may help explain how weaving developed during the period.The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 1978.",

Located atop a bluff above the Muskingum River, it is one of Washington County's most significant houses, due to its age and method of construction.Joshua Sprague and his brothers William and Jonathan migrated to Marietta in 1788, less than a year after it was founded as the first white settlement in the Northwest Territory; there, they soon signed a contract to contribute to the construction of Campus Martius.  After living in Marietta for a time, the three men moved to the vicinity of present-day Waterford; Joshua and William later left the area, but Jonathan remained where he had settled.  Here, he farmed, pursued the trade of carpentry, and operated a gristmill.At the age of thirty-three, Jonathan constructed the present house.  Built in the Federal style of architecture, it is three-and-a-half stories tall and built primarily of large blocks of sandstone.  When it was completed in 1800, it was the first stone house to be built anywhere in Washington County.  Sprague's barn, completed in 1803, is also historically significant as one of the oldest extant barns in the county.In 1983, the Jonathan Sprague House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the barn.  Key to this designation was the property's nature as a rare survivor of Ohio's earliest architecture: architectural historians have seen the house as a fine example of the Federal architecture, and the barn \u2014 while architecturally undistinctive \u2014 is nevertheless an important survivor of the earliest years of Washington County's history.  Located west of Lowell across the Muskingum from State Route 60, it is close to two other historic sites: the Mason House and the Coal Run Historic District, both located in the community of Coal Run, lie approximately 0.75 miles (1.21 km) to the northwest.",

Originally home to one of the area's oldest families, it was built in the middle of the nineteenth century in a mix of architectural styles.  Named a historic site in the 1980s, it has been converted into a health care facility.\nA native of Delaware, Robert Kirkwood emigrated to present-day Belmont County in 1789 after fighting in the American Revolution; he and his family were among the region's first settlers.  Joseph his son erected the present house in 1846 and arranged for its expansion seven years later by the construction of a large ell to the rear.  Set on a foundation of sandstone, the wood-and-brick house is covered with a metal roof.  The house combines academic and popular architectural styles: the basic plan is that of an I-house, a vernacular construction mode, although Greek Revival styling is present, especially in the careful symmetry of the five-bay facade.  Nine windows fill all bays in both stories, except for the post and lintel-surrounded main entrance in the center of the first story.  The fenestration on the side of the original house and on the addition is more irregular: on the second story, a single window sits under the gable, separated by large amounts of brick from a trio of windows at the rear of the ell.  Chimneys are placed at both ends of the roofline on the original house, with another such structure in the ell; the roof itself is metal.In early 1986, the Kirkwood House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; its connection to Joseph Kirkwood qualified it for designation, as did its historically significant architecture.  It is one of two National Register-listed locations in Bridgeport: although located largely in Wheeling, West Virginia across the Ohio River, the Wheeling Island Historic District includes the Aetnaville Bridge, which extends into Bridgeport.  By the time of listing, the Kirkwood House was no longer used as a typical residence, having been converted into a group home for the mentally retarded, \"Thresholds to Tomorrow\".",

Cory Jensen, in its NRHP nomination, wrote:\nThe Davis house is a good example of the transitional character of the architecture on the Provo Bench\nat the latter-part of the 19th century. The salmon-colored, soft-fired brick, found on many of the homes\nin the region, became available on the Provo Bench in the early 1880s which allowed for greater\nvariation in used in Victorian-style architecture. Although Classical in form, the Victorian influence in\nthe architectural details is readily apparent. Because many of the farmers on the bench struggled to\nmake an income for many years, the architecture of their homes remained in the simple,\nunembellished Classical-style architecture of their predecessors. Those who saw success in their\nfarms began to build or alter their present homes in the Victorian styles, mainly the Victorian Eclectic\nwhich enlisted such details as asymmetrical facades, bay windows, arched window and door openings,\nwooden shingles on the vertical surfaces, decorative brickwork, and leaded-glass windows.

There, they found a local tradition of utilitarian pottery in orange, earthenware, and salt glazes. The Busbees saw an opportunity to help save a dying craft, and in 1918 they set up the village store in Greenwich Village, New York, in order to sell the pottery. Potters they worked with over the years included J. H. Owen, Charlie Teague, and Ben Owen.Jacques died in 1947. In 1960, John Mare bought Jugtown Pottery and hired Vernon Owens as the Jugtown thrower. After the sudden deaths of Mare and Juliana in 1962, Owens leased the business and kept it going for six years, until it was sold to Country Roads, Inc., a nonprofit organization working toward the preservation of hand crafts.\nUnder the direction of Country Roads, Nancy Sweezy served as director and potter. Sweezy changed the earthenware glazes to fritted lead glazes, then developed a new line of high temperature glazes in order to make them lead-free. She also developed a completely different line of complex colors, including Blueridge Blue, Cinnamon, a different Tobacco Spit, Mustard and Dogwood White. Sweezy also set up an apprenticeship program that served over thirty pottery students from 1969 through 1980.\nIn 1983 Country Roads moved on to another project, and Vernon Owens bought Jugtown. He has run it with his wife Pam Owens since then. Pam and Vernon opened the Jugtown Museum in 1988. Jugtown Pottery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.  The listing includes the log sales room, log turning room with attached pugmill, frame glaze room, and two kilns beneath a shelter, all built about 1921, and the house added to the complex about 1924.Jugtown Pottery is located near the Pottery Road on North Carolina Highway 705, an area known for many potteries.",

The design of the houses was described as the \"New York Style\" in which unit was given a distinctive character found in some rowhouses in eastern cities.  Architecture critic Larry Millett describes it as \"A brownstone row house that leaves no Victorian style unaccounted for, although the general flavor is Romanesque Revival.\"  The Fitzgerald house is faced with brownstone and is two bays wide with a polygonal two-story window bay on the right, and the entrance, recessed under a round arch that is flush with the bay front, on the left.  The mansard roof has a  cross-gable with two round-arch windows and decorative finials.Fitzgerald's parents, Edward and Mollie, moved back to St. Paul in 1914 while F. Scott Fitzgerald was a student at Princeton University.  They lived in the unit at 593 Summit Avenue for a while, then moved to the 599 Summit Avenue unit in 1918.  In July and August 1919, Fitzgerald rewrote the manuscript that became his first novel, This Side of Paradise.  He lived here until January 1920, writing short stories, and then moved to New Orleans.  Of the several places the Fitzgeralds lived, this one is most closely associated with his literary fame, and typifies the environments of some of his later works.It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971.

It was then operated as a summer hotel by his widow and daughters until World War II.\nThe log structure is built of timber cut, sawn and hauled by Ezra Kauffman.  The logs were sawn on three sides and left rounded on the outside. Inside walls were lined with metal and a muslin facing, with wallpaper pasted to the fabric in most rooms, with colored fabric left exposed in some rooms. Oilcloth was used on the kitchen walls and ceiling. The logs were laid on a stone foundation.  Gables are finished in fish-scale shingles. The house featured an indoor water supply fed from a galvanized tank in the attic, which was filled from a hand pump at the lakeshore. Water was hauled by hand in the winter.In 1946 the Kauffmans sold the house to Henry Rhone who operated it until 1973, when the Grand Lake Historical Society purchased the house for use as a museum. It is the only pre-20th century log hotel remaining in Grand Lake.The Kauffman House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1974.",

        "long_description": "St. Paul's Episcopal Church is a historic Carpenter Gothic style Episcopal church building located on a triangular lot at 416 Southeast Grand Avenue at the corner of Fifth and Green streets in Lee's Summit, Missouri, United States. The parish was established in 1867. The original sanctuary and current building were designed by the Rev. Frederick B. Scheetz and completed in 1884. The building is a rare example of an extant wood framed Carpenter Gothic church in the state of Missouri. The interior walls and vaulted ceilings are covered with narrow strips of wood paneling set diagonally on the walls and horizontally on the ceiling. A trio of stained glass windows is set above the wooden altar in the apse at the north end of the transept. The church has received few if any alterations since it was built in 1884.\nAn early description of the newly built church would be accurate today: \"The church is frame, 40 feet by 24, with a porch in front 8 by 10 feet, with a bell tower extending above the roof. It is strongly and well built, with a solid stone foundation, which is so high in the rear of the church as to give room for a cellar for wood. The interior is ceiled throughout with narrow stuff put on diagonally, the timbers above do not show.\"'St. Paul's Episcopal Church embodies a distinctive; type of 'vernacular' adaptation to the earlier Gothic Revival style important in church construction. Economic exigencies as well as available materials quite probably limited this Midwestern frame structure to a relatively small derivative of the more expansive models constructed in the eastern United States. The simple form and decorative features of St. Paul's reflect the Midwestern 19th century philosophy of spiritual beliefs constrained by the realities of the time and place. The continuity in the structure can easily be interpreted to reflect the continuity in the religious community, which began and still maintains the building. St. Paul's Episcopal was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 9, 1985.",

Built during the Great Depression era of high unemployment and falling prices, the four million dollar budget for the building was underspent, and the quality of materials and craftsmanship were higher than initially envisioned. The exterior consists of smooth Indiana limestone in the Art Deco style known as \"American Perpendicular\", designed by Thomas Ellerbe & Company of Saint Paul and Holabird & Root of Chicago and inspired by Finnish architect, Eliel Saarinen. The vertical rows of windows are linked by plain, flat, black spandrels.  Above the Fourth Street entrance and flanking the Kellogg Boulevard entrance are relief sculptures carved by Lee Lawrie.\n\nThe interior design in the \"Zigzag Moderne\" style drew its inspiration from the Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes, which promoted soft ornamentation and sensuous curves.  In Memorial Hall the white marble floor contrasts with three-story black marble piers leading to a gold-leaf ceiling. At the end of the hall is the 60-ton, 38 feet (11.6 m) white onyx Indian God of Peace by Carl Milles (later renamed Vision of Peace).

Gompers was an English-born American who grew up working in cigar factories, where he witnessed the long hours and dangerous conditions people experienced in factory jobs. He helped with growing the Cigar Makers' International Union, and a few years later, founded the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The number of members rose from 50,000 to 3,000,000 during his time as president of the union. He was not only successful in expanding the power of the labor movement, but also increased its prestige.\nA year after Gomper's death, it was suggested a memorial be placed in Washington, D.C., that would honor the labor hero. While fundraising for the project took place amongst AFL members, Robert Ingersoll Aitken was selected to create the sculptures. In 1933, the unveiling and dedication of the memorial, located just one block from the American Federation of Labor Building, took place. Amongst the dignitaries present at the ceremony were a number of labor leaders, Eleanor Roosevelt, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who spoke at the event.\nThe memorial has been repaired on occasion since its installation. The lot where the statue stands was renamed Samuel Gompers Memorial Park in 1955. The memorial depicts Gompers seated and six figures behind him, each representing a facet of labor history. The memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 2007, eight years after it was designated a contributing property to the Mount Vernon West Historic District.",

The Tucker family retained possession of the house until 1953.\nThe house was purchased by, and became the first project of, the newly organized Galveston Historic Foundation.  Restoration was partially funded by a grant from the Moody Foundation.  In 2007, the executive director of the GHF, stated \"I can hardly overemphasize the importance of this house, not only to Galveston and Texas history, but to the history and affections of our organization.\"  The house was opened to the public in 1959, restored to its original look in the late 1970s, and opened to regular tours in 1984.

        "long_description": "Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site is a National Historic Site in Kiowa County, Colorado, commemorating the Sand Creek Massacre that occurred here on November 29, 1864. The site is considered sacred after the unprovoked assault on an encampment of approximately 750 Native people resulted in the murder of hundreds of men, women and children. Near Eads and Chivington, the site is about 170 miles (270 km) southeast of Denver and about 125 miles (200 km) east of Pueblo. A few basic park facilities have been opened at this site.\n\nIn 1999, archaeological teams from the National Park Service, Dept. of the Interior BLM, Colorado Historical Society and accompanied by Native American observers, made a major archaeological discovery of remains of the massacre site. Large numbers of period bullets, camp equipment, and other items convinced the NPS that they had found the correct site.\n\nThe Historic Site was authorized by Public Law 106-465 on November 7, 2000, in order to \"recognize the national significance of the massacre in American history, and its ongoing significance to the Cheyenne and Arapaho people and the descendants of the massacre victims.\"  The law authorized establishment of the site once the National Park Service acquired sufficient land from willing sellers to preserve, commemorate, and interpret the massacre. The site near the junction of County Road 54 and County Road \"W\" was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 28, 2001. The site contains a small visitor center, interpretive plaques and signage, monuments located on a hilltop overlooking the massacre site, and two walking trails.  The massacre site itself is off-limits to visitors. \nOn August 2, 2005, President George W. Bush gave final approval for the site. On April 23, 2007 it was announced that site would become America's 391st official park unit with an effective date of April 27, 2007. The dedication ceremony was held on April 28, 2007. In October 2022, leaders from the Northern Arapaho Tribe, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes along with descendants of some of the massacre\u2019s victims and survivors joined Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland at the site as she announced the  purchase of an additional 3,478 acres (1,407 ha). The area included lands listed on the National Register of Historic Places for their significance. Archaeological remains include evidence of the village where Cheyenne and Arapaho families were camped, along with an intact viewshed that is key to the integrity of the site. The expansion of the site contributed to one of the most intact shortgrass prairie ecosystems within the National Park system, providing habitat for a wide range of plants, wildlife and species of special concern.Currently the site encompasses 12,583 acres (50.92 km2) of which 2,385 acres (9.65 km2) are federally owned. By 2004 the federal government acquired 920 acres (3.7 km2) from private land owners. On September 9, 2006 the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma conveyed to the United States title to 1,465 acres (6 km2) to be held in trust for the National Historic Site. The site includes 640 acres (260 ha) acquired and preserved by the American Battlefield Trust and its partners.\n\n",

In 1995, the building was allegedly examined as a target by Timothy McVeigh prior to his involvement in the Oklahoma City Bombing, although this fact was not substantiated by the FBI.In December 2011, the building was sold to developers who planned on turning it into a 152-room Residence Inn by Marriott. The $23 million project was expected to be completed by 2013, and opened to guests in October 2013. In order to keep the building on the NRHP, the exterior facade remains the same, as do some of the original interior features, such as terrazzo marble floors.",

A Baptist congregation was formed in the community in 1858, and eight years later, the church was formally organized.  In 1867, the membership split amidst a disagreement between members who wanted a more aggressive evangelical mission and members who wanted the status quo.  One of the groups moved ahead with plans to build a church, contracting for the delivery of logs to a nearby sawmill.  The sawmill was unable to receive the logs before winter came, though, and the logs were washed away in spring flooding.\n\nThe congregation then made plans to build a church from concrete blocks made in the town by the firm of Geist and Hentzelman.  This structure is believed to be the earliest in the state built of concrete block or artificial stone.  The structure was dedicated on January 17, 1869, and the two groups reunited and used it jointly.  It measures 33 feet (10 m) by 55 feet (17 m) and was completed at a cost of $4,100.Congregationalists and Presbyterians also held services in this building for a time as a combined congregation.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.",

After the fire on his rubber shoe factory in 1875, he purchased the swamp planning to turn it into a water reservoir in case of emergency. Later, following the advice of the noted journalist Sylvester Baxter, he donated the land for establishing a beautiful public park with a pond.  In 1905 the city turned the park over to the Metropolitan Parks Commission (MPC, predecessor to the Metropolitan District Commission and today's Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)).  The MPC in 1913 designed the boundary roads of the park (West Border Road and Boundary Road), which were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 2003 as Fellsmere Park Parkways.

Conway and James W. Hoit began the Mission Canal Co. Irrigation system, which was instrumental in the early agricultural growth of the area. Here, they built the first pump station. The pump was powered by steam produced by wood-fired boilers. The chimney, which still stands at the site, was made out of handmade brick from Madero. It is 106 feet tall and 6 feet in diameter. The top of the chimney has a double row of bricks that form a partial design, but the top was never completed. The chimney was dedicated as a Texas Historic Landmark by the Texas Historical Commission in 1985.\nThe boilers began operation in 1907 and the lift station started to pump water from the Rio Grande.  Wood was used in units of 2 to 3 cords (7 to 11 m\u00b3) and a crew of 26 men with teams of mules worked around the clock to keep the boilers fed.\nThe plant was later operated by John H. Shary and by Hidalgo County Water Control and Improvement Districts No. 7 and No. 14. The property was developed for recreational use after dams and a new pumping plant were built upstream in the late 1950s. The chimney is still standing at the site of Chimney Park.",

The building was the first known implementation of Art Deco architecture in the county and was spectacular.  It was followed a year later by the Shrine Building (Miami, Florida), an application of Art Deco with local Seminole Indian motifs added as an interesting twist.  Both were covered in a 1988 study of Downtown Miami historic resources, but were not NRHP-listed due to owner objections at the time.:\u200a11,\u200a30\u200a It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 8, 1997. Only its tower remains.\nAfter the area's drastic decline in the early 1980s, the building's intense structural decay, and declining sales, the store closed for good in 1983. The building remained vacant and abandoned and was the subject to graffiti and vandalism. Sears was unable to sell the property and it donated the site to Dade County in 1992. That same year, the Sears signs were removed.\nThe building listing was added to the National Register on August 8, 1997. By 2001, the only surviving part of the original structure was a seven-story tower. The original department store space had been demolished. The tower was preserved and incorporated it into the new Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, built in 2006.\nThe Sears building at one point absorbed a former Burdines department store.  The Art Deco building was constructed in 1929, predating the Art Deco hotels on Ocean Drive in Miami Beach.",

It is the largest historical h\u014dlua course left in the islands. H\u014dlua slides were used in the extremely dangerous activity of sliding across solidified lava surface.\nThough many had believed for years that this ritualistic practice was restricted to the ali\u02bbi class of men, this is not the case. The majority of oral and written histories of he\u02bbeh\u014dlua prior to missionary/western influence was inclusive of the female as well as the male nobility of ancient Hawaii.  Contrary to popular belief, he\u02bbeh\u014dlua was widely practiced among all the Kanaka Maoli community throughout the Kingdom. This particular h\u014dlua course was primarily used for ritualistic purposes, but perhaps there were times when it was openly used. There are several burials found throughout the slide area suggesting that injuries and death were common when sliding down this particular course. The remaining length of the slide is approx. 2,600 feet (790 m) long, of the original length which was said to be over 5,280 feet (1,600 m) long. The slide course ended on the shoreline at He\u02bbeia Bay. Small portions of the h\u014dlua course are still remain on the shoreline at the end of the h\u014dlua slide where the waves meet the rock coastline. When constructed it was first layered with large slabs of p\u0101hoehoe lava with smaller and smaller lava material added until the kahua h\u014dlua was finished off with a fine ash surface to cover those larger pieces of lava rock. When in use, it was covered lightly with pili grass to provide a medium surface to minimize the friction between the papah\u014dlua and lava rock surface during the practice of he\u02bbeh\u014dlua. Today, there is one other usable kahua h\u014dlua slide that was constructed in 2011 and is located at Turtle Bay Resort. Other than that he\u02bbeh\u014dlua is practiced today in pastures on the high slopes of Hawai\u02bbi Island and Maui, as well as on groomed grass hills throughout Hawai\u02bbi.\nThe K\u0101neaka H\u014dlua Slide was connected to the Makahiki games. It can be seen from Ali\u02bbi Highway, across from the Kona Country Club golf course clubhouse. The slide originally went into He\u02bbeia Bay, but the part below the road was destroyed and is now used by a golf course and vacation homes. The preserved parts above the road are best viewed from the air, e.g. satellite images at 19\u00b033\u203244.43\u2033N 155\u00b057\u203230.5\u2033W\nThis area was used by the royal families such as the King Kamehameha III and King David Kal\u0101kaua.By the 1950s trees and shrubs were encroaching on the sides of the slide, and sections had settled due to earthquakes. It was added to the list of National Historic Landmarks in Hawaii on December 29, 1962, and added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on October 15, 1966.\nA small museum at the nearby Keauhou Shopping Center includes a reproduction of a h\u014dlua sled and more information about the other historic sites in the area.",

It was built in 1753 for Jacob Keim and his wife Magdalena Hoch on land given to the couple by her father. Jacob was the son of Johannes Keim, who immigrated from Germany in 1689 and scouted the Pennsylvania countryside for land that was similar in richness to the soil from the Black Forest of Germany. He thought he found it and returned to Germany, married his wife, Katarina. They came to America in 1707. Keim originally built a log structure for his family's housing and later a stone home along Keim Road in Pike Township. The main section of the Jacob and Magdelena Keim house on Boyer Road was built in two phases and it is, \"replete with early German construction features ... including[an] extremely original second floor Chevron door.\" The exterior building material (cladding) is limestone. The finishings and trimmings are mostly original to the house; relatively unusual in a home of this period.\nThe Historic Preservation Trust of Berks County describes the house in this way:\n\nIt is a two and a half story limestone structure. The building originally had a red clay tile roof but currently is covered by a standing metal seam roof. The walk-in fireplaces and much of the woodwork and hardware are intact. The foundation and walls are made of native limestone. It is a stove-room house with facades that have a balanced look and interiors illuminated by many windows. A stove-room house has a three room first floor plan that includes a kitchen on one side of a centrally located fireplace and a \"stove\" room or family space and a bedroom on the opposite side of this fireplace. The central stone chimney is capped by a brick section which protrudes the roof line. The original house block has segmented arches over all exterior openings.\nThere have been subsequent additions to the house, especially porches in later centuries. The Hartman Cider Press was moved from its original location in Muhlenberg Township, 11 miles to the Keim Homestead in 1975.The Keim Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016 as a nationally significant example of German colonial architecture.",

Composed largely of houses constructed after the Great Flood of 1913, the district features examples of several prominent architectural styles, and it has received both local and federal recognition.\nFollowing the 1913 flood, many wealthy residents decided to flee the older parts of the city, located in the floodplain along the Great Miami River.  The result was the development of Kenilworth Avenue, whose houses feature a range of design modes, including the Italianate, Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival, and Neoclassical styles.  Also known as \"Dayton View Heights\" (the district is just three blocks north of the larger Dayton View Historic District), the Kenilworth Avenue development includes twenty separate buildings, located on both sides of the street from Redfern Avenue west to its end at Salem Avenue.  Seventeen of these buildings qualified as contributing properties to the district, while three were considered non-contributing: the district's period of significance was held to have ended in 1949, and some of the buildings were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s.  Among the oldest properties in the district is the house at the corner of Kenilworth and Salem, which was constructed in 1906.  When the street was developed, many of the new residents desired to live in a park-like setting, and as a result, the street's well-preserved landscaping is itself a significant part of the historic district.On March 1, 2006, Dayton City Commission modified the neighborhood's zoning classification by designating the area a local historic district, and it was subsequently added to the National Register of Historic Places five months later.  Federal designation places no restrictions on the residents' abilities to modify or destroy buildings in the district, but local designation means that local authorities must approve changes to the district's properties.  When designated, Kenilworth Avenue was the city's twelfth official historic district, and its eighteenth National Register district.  It is one of six northwest-side historic districts, along with Dayton View, Grafton-Rockwood, Squirrel-Forest, McPherson Town, and Steele's Hill-Grafton Hill.",

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a member of the Historic House Trust.\nJames Seguine is believed to have purchased property near Lemon Creek between 1780 and 1786, and his grandson Joseph H. Seguine built the house on the property in 1838. At the time, he added a hay barn, carriage house and stables. Joseph was a prominent businessman in the area, founding several companies including the Staten Island Railroad company. He died in 1856. In 1868, the family was forced to sell the house and land. In 1916, descendants were able to repurchase the house and it remained in the family until 1981.In 1981 the house was in serious need of repair, and was sold to George Burke, who had previously restored other historic buildings in the community. Burke not only saved the building but also ensured that the property would not be subdivided. The renovation of the outside of the house took more than five years and sixty gallons of paint. Burke filled the house with his elaborate collection of art and furnishings, many acquired during his years in England after World War II, while he was in the Air Force. After restoring the house and establishing an equestrian center at the site, Burke donated the Seguine Mansion to the City of New York in 1989, and retains a life interest in the site.\nThe New York City Parks Department owns the house. Tours are scheduled by Friends of the Seguine Mansion, by appointment only. The Friends of Seguine Mansion is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization formed for the purpose to own, operate, manage, and do everything normally associated with conducting the business of fund-raising for the care and maintenance of the Seguine Mansion residence and grounds, together with the power to solicit grants and contributions for the corporate purposes.",

Shawsheen Village was completed in the early 1920s as a planned corporate community. Conceived by William Madison Wood of the American Woolen Company, the village was designed a team of architects including Adden & Parker, Clifford Allbright and Ripley & LeBoutillier of Boston and James E. Allen of Lawrence. John Franklin, a civil engineer for the American Woolen Company was responsible for designing the village, under the direction of Wood. Buildings from the original Frye Village were also incorporated into the design which included a railroad station, shops, apartment buildings, factories, parks and numerous single-family dwellings.  The village was located just up the road from the Company's main factories in nearby Lawrence.\nThe village was roughly divided into three sections.  The westernmost of these sections, around the junction of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28) with Massachusetts Route 133 (Lowell Street to the west, Haverhill Street to the east), was the village center, with shops, a post office.  Immediately east of this area, descending to the Shawsheen River, was the industrial area.  One residential area was primarily north and west of this central area, and it provided housing for the upper level executives of the Company.  The third area was east and south of the industrial area, spilling across the railroad tracks and river, where middle class worker housing was provided.  Sprinkled throughout were old houses from the Frye Village settlement that were relocated according to Wood's vision.Although the company community was well conceived, it was short-lived.  William Wood committed suicide in 1926, and the single ownership strategy of the community began to fall apart.  Most of the company's properties were purchased by a realty trust in 1932 and resold, often to the tenants of the property.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.",

The house was probably built between 1685 and 1713, probably by Joseph Stanton (1646-1713), the third son of Thomas Stanton (1616-1677), one of the original settlers in this area. Joseph's son Thomas (1691 aft. 1720), had no surviving sons, so the farm was deeded in 1753 to his son-in-law Nathaniel Sheffield (1712-1790) the husband of Rebecca Stanton (1713-1775). Today the house is called the Stanton-Sheffield house.\nSince 1845, when the Sheffields sold the house, it has been in the hands of several owners, all of whom have respected its integrity. The Sheffield House is an outstanding example of a Rhode Island farmhouse which has remained relatively unaltered from its construction at the turn of the 17th century. Said to be the oldest home in Charlestown and in an excellent state of preservation, it is a living document of early settlement and vernacular architect.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.",

It was built in 1853 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.The Shopiere congregation was established in 1844 by Reverend Stephen Peet, riding over from Beloit.  The members initially met in a log schoolhouse, then in a small chapel which they built at the south end of the church before the church was built. In 1850 they began constructing the main block of the building pictured.That main block has walls of rough-cut locally quarried limestone laid in courses. Its style is simple Greek Revival, suggested by the pitch of the roof, the frieze board, and the entablature in the gable end. The main block was completed in 1853 at a cost of $2,000. The tower at the front was added in the following years, rectangular and wooden with two round-arched windows on the front and an entry door on each side.  Resting on the tower is an octagonal belfry, and from that rises a graceful steeple topped with a cross. The style of the tower and belfry are rather unusual for Wisconsin, and may result from some early members' New England origins. In 1871 the tall Gothic-styled pointed-arch windows were added on the sides of the church, and the original chapel at the back was replaced with a new chapel.Louis P. Harvey, briefly governor of Wisconsin during the Civil War, is the most famous member of the Shopiere congregation. Today the church is probably the second oldest continuously used church in Rock County.",

George H. Utter obtained a contract to supply water to Silver City in 1886, and he commissioned Michigan stonemason John Hill to build the water works. The sandstone water works is the only sandstone building from the 1800s in Silver City, as brick was a much more common building material. While the water system opened and initially operated successfully, by 1890 Utter was accused of supplying undrinkable water and failing to meet the city's expectations for service. East Coast investors Henry and Thomas Foster took over the water works in the ensuing years after an extended legal battle with Utter.The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.",

There the boulder sat as the leader of a herd of reclining buffalo envisioned in an outcrop of granite. Incised markings made in the distant past define its horns, eyes, backbone, and ribs. Since late prehistoric times, native peoples of the Northern Plains have revered the Sleeping Buffalo's spiritual power. Oral traditions reveal that it was well known to the Cree, Chippewa, Sioux, Assiniboine, and Gros Ventre as well as the more distant Blackfeet, Crow, and Northern Cheyenne. Stories passed from generation to generation tell how the \"herd\" fooled more than one buffalo-hunting party. While each tribe has its own culture and beliefs, native peoples share a worldview intertwining the sacred and secular. A Chippewa-Cree elder explained, \"These rocks are sacred, just like our old people.\" In 1932, the Sleeping Buffalo was separated from its ridgetop companions. Relocated to the City Park in Malta, the Sleeping Buffalo was said to have been restless; stories are told of its changing position and nighttime bellowing. Moved to this site in 1967 from old Highway 2, the Sleeping Buffalo was later rejoined by the larger \"Medicine Rock\" in 1987, also collected near Cree Crossing. These timeless objects continue to figure prominently in traditional ceremonies. They provide a link to ancestral peoples of the high plains and the long ago time when, as one elder put it, \"The power of the prairie was the buffalo.\"\n\n",

The Towles sold the house in 1933 for $1 during the Great Depression under the condition that the owners cared for Julia Towle. Constructed during the transition time between Greek Revival and Italianate styles, the vernacular building is often classified as \"upright-and-wing\". The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1979.",

In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe largest silver nugget ever mined, weighing 1,840 pounds (830 kg), came from Smuggler. At its peak the mine was responsible for nearly one-fifth of the world's total silver output. Its extensive tunnel system reaches more than a thousand feet (300 m) below the entrance, extending under the city of Aspen, although most of the lower tunnels are presently flooded.\nSmuggler was one of the few mines in the Aspen area to reopen after the 1893 repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. It continued producing ore until 1918, and was reopened in the 1970s. In 1984 it was designated a Superfund site after tests found high levels of lead and cadmium in the soil. It took the Environmental Protection Agency 12 years to clean up the site. While it is estimated that nearly a million pounds (400,000 kg) of recoverable ore remain in the mine, it is used as much for tours today as mining. In 2012 it and two nearby lots were put up for sale.\n\n",

        "short_description": "historic house in New York, United States",
        "long_description": "LeRay (pronounced /\u2019leh-ray/) Mansion is a National Register Listed Historic District located in Fort Drum, NY. The LeRay Mansion was originally built as the estate for James LeRay de Chaumont. James LeRay originally came to the North Country in order to regain his family\u2019s fortune. Jacques Donatien LeRay de Chaumont, James LeRay\u2019s father, was a French entrepreneur who loaned a considerable portion of his fortune to support the American Revolution. Jacques LeRay was the single largest financial supporter of the American Revolution from France, outspending the French Government. This earned Jacques LeRay the name French \u201cFather of the American Revolution.\u201d Jacques LeRay was a gracious host to members of the new Continental government at his estate in Passy, France. These guests included John Adams, Silas Deane, Arthur Lee, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin, the latter of whom taught English to James LeRay.           Jacques never made the journey to America, but by the time the American Revolutionary War ended, Jacques had nearly bled his fortune dry in his support. Instead of making the journey himself, Jacques sent his son, James, on his behalf to collect their fortune. Despite years of effort, James was never able to secure full compensation for his father's loan. Benjamin Franklin wrote an impassioned letter to George Washington that was able to secure a partial payment.\n           While James LeRay was pleading for payment on his family's loan, he met and married a wealthy woman named Grace Coxe. The Coxe family made their own fortune through a successful newspaper business in New Jersey. After their marriage, James became a naturalized American citizen and believed he could reclaim his family fortune by investing in land in Northern New York. Grace Coxe and James LeRay had three children Therese, Vincent, and Alexander.\n           James was able to obtain ownership of thousands of acres within the tri-county area in the North Country (Jefferson, Lewis, and St. Lawrence County) which included over 360,000 acres of land. Setting aside 200 acres for his estate, James LeRay built the LeRay Mansion.The first mansion was built around 1808. According to numerous records, there was a fire at this mansion in the 1820s. Some historians argue whether the fire destroyed the first mansion, and it is unclear whether the building that stands today was a rebuild or a completely different mansion. In either case, a mansion was rebuilt around 1826\u20131827. While there were still Native Americans residing in the area, there were no significant European-American settlements or infrastructure. James LeRay intended to rebuild his family's fortune by selling off tracts of his land to build European-American settlements. James LeRay was not discriminatory towards Christian religious denominations and encouraged settlement of Quakers, Catholics, and Protestant denominations. He gave them land for their congregations' churches and meeting houses. James LeRay was ultimately unsuccessful in reclaiming his family's fortune and almost went bankrupt. He transferred the ownership of the estate to his oldest son, Vincent, for whom Cape Vincent is named. Vincent owned the Mansion briefly before selling the property to Jules Rene Payen a geologic engineer, gun-powder chemist, and fellow French immigrant.The LeRay Mansion remained in the Payen family for several generations, however their surname changed from Payen to Phelps to Anderson as the house was passed down through the family's daughters. While the estate was in the possession of the Anderson family in 1936, the NY State Land Bank foreclosed on the property.In 1936, Colonel Harold Remington (Ret.), a local resident of Watertown, NY and a World War I veteran, purchased the property and carried out repairs and renovations. Some of the repairs included adding electricity and plumbing to the Mansion. The house was only briefly in the possession of the Remington family as in 1941, the US Army took ownership of the estate for the expansion of Pine Camp. In 1941, with the outbreak of World War II, the federal government granted the expansion of Pine Camp by 75,000 acres. This expansion displaced not only the Remington family from the LeRay Mansion, but over 525 families from five villages and over 360 farms: Sterlingville; Woods Mills; Lewisburg; LeRaysville; Alpina.Over the years, the Army used the Mansion for temporary lodging and an officer's club. When the 10th Mountain Division was reactivated on Fort Drum in 1984, General Carpenter was asked to live at the LeRay Mansion. This briefly gave the LeRay Mansion the nickname, \u201cthe General\u2019s Mansion.\u201d In 1988, General Carpenter gave the mansion over to the Army Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) program. MWR used the mansion as a \u201cBed and Breakfast\u201d style lodging for visiting VIPs and officials. The Lodging Program generously furnished the Mansion with pieces in keeping with the style of the early nineteenth century and the Commanding General began a tradition of hosting members of the community there for holiday celebrations.\nIn 2018, the LeRay Mansion was turned over to the Fort Drum Public Works Environmental Cultural Resources Program, in part due to the efforts of LTG Piatt. Today, the space is used as a free event space for the greater Fort Drum community and museum. As a part of their mission to identify, protect, and manage the ancestral places and historic era archeological sites, Cultural Resources works to preserve one of Fort Drum's most valued historic resources, the LeRay Mansion. There are daily tours held at the LeRay Mansion and the surrounding grounds where anyone is welcome. The Mansion is open on weekdays from 0900 to 1500. Check out the Leray Mansion website (leraymansion.com) for questions, to reserve the mansion for an event, or to check out current and future exhibits at the LeRay Mansion.\n\n",

        "short_description": "church building in Baltimore, United States of America",
        "long_description": "Leadenhall Street Baptist Church is a historic Baptist church located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States.  It is a gable-front rectangular brick temple with simple Renaissance Revival detail. The original exterior wall surfaces have been covered with formstone on the main fa\u00e7ade and stucco elsewhere.  It features round-arched stained glass windows on each side bay.  It was built in 1873, by Joseph Thomas & Son for the city's African American Baptists who were then centered in the old southwest area from the downtown business district of Baltimore in the \"Sharp-Leadenhall\" (named for the intersecting nearby streets) community in the old \"South Baltimore\" area. Nearby is its now famed revitalized \"Inner Harbor\" area of the old \"Basin\" for the harbor port.\nThe neighborhood is just west of the Federal Hill community and commercial district connected by West Hamburg Street, which is along South Charles and Light Streets, and the famous hill itself, which was the site of a celebratory picnic in 1788 after a parade of the various guilds, organizations and military units of old \"Baltimore Town\" to commemorate the ratification by Maryland of the new Federal Constitution, and later fortified with earthen embankments and large cannons of artillery by Northern troops of the Union Army a month after, during the Civil War to keep a close watch on and control on the Southern-sympathizing citizens of the City who had erupted in April 1861, in a riot attacking passing Massachusetts and Pennsylvania troops from the President Street Station on the east side from Philadelphia and the North, on their way to the nearby (a few blocks away with the Washington tracks running right by the Church) Camden Street Station of the famous Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to defend the National Capital of Washington from the newly seceded Virginians and Confederates.\nThe \"Sharp-Leadenhall\" neighborhood just west of the Harbor was one of the first neighborhoods to become predominantly African American residents among the City's largest free-Black population in America, in the late 19th century. Prior to this era of beginning housing segregation, most of Baltimore's \"free citizens of color\" lived amidst the white population in the small compact town, residing on the smaller streets and alleyways in between larger avenues and main streets, seeking employment in the homes and businesses of the majority white population.  Often poorer  residents, lived right in back or around the corner from substantial mansions and townhouses of the wealthy and well-to-do. In later years, additional populations of free blacks began moving to the northwest just beyond the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood and beyond Seton Hill, along the future Pennsylvania Avenue and Druid Hill Avenue of what became known as Upton.\nThe building was built and financed by the predominantly \"colored\" Maryland Baptist Union Association, (as opposed to the organization of the Baptist Convention of Maryland) who had generally separated from the white Baptists after often worshipping together in the small building during the colonial days of the late 18th century (although most of the time in upper balconies or separate pews/chairs in the sanctuary), into the early 19th century of the American Republic.  It is the second oldest Black church edifice in Baltimore, and home to one of the city's largest African American congregations.\nAnother prominent congregation in the area that was an important force in the City's burgeoning African-American community was the nearby Sharp Street Methodist Church which later followed its members in later decades also to the northwest neighborhoods, where after a series of National Methodist church mergers is now still called Sharp Street United Methodist Church, although it left that location long ago, unlike the Leadenhall Church.\nLeadenhall Street Baptist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. which is maintained by the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior, according to the Historic Sites Act of August 1935. With the designation of much of downtown Baltimore and its immediate inner eastern, western and northern residential historic neighborhoods as the Baltimore City National Heritage Area has been established.  Under the same NPS and USDI influence and direction, with local supervision from city and state historical professionals, a series of new additional huge plaques have been mounted on streetside poles with illustrations, maps and text of the various historic sites, buildings, monuments and various tours of the heritage areas in the immediate block of that particular sign. On the other side is similar material for the BCNHA in general, and exhibits/tours available to be led and run out of the Visitors Center pavilion, along the western shore of the \"Inner Harbor\", with the additional printed brochures containing maps, pictures and text plus the material available on an internet website.  Prominent display is given to the African-American heritage in the southwest \"Sharp-Leadenhall\"  and northwest \"Upton/Druid Hill\" areas by the Pennsylvania Avenue commercial and entertainment/social district.  It points out the Leadenhall Church site and many other black churches and institutions with the homes and locations of significant people.",

Leander Reeve came to Franklin County from Ashtabula County, Ohio in 1853.  He initially worked as a trapper until he acquired 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land from Allison Phelps and began to farm.  He built the stone house in 1854 and brought his family from Ohio the same year.  It is the first permanent structure built in the county.  His wife did not care for the pioneer lifestyle and they returned to Ohio three years later.  Although some said she wanted to have her last child at her Ohio home, and she also didn't get along with her sister in law. Simeon Carter bought the house from the Reeves.  His daughter and son-in-law, a lawyer named D. W. Dow, were the next people to live in the house.  They were followed by 13 other families.  The floor plan of the house has never been altered and it did not have electricity until the restoration committee had plug-ins installed.  The house is still in excellent shape, and an Old Stone House Committee remains active through the Franklin County Historical Society.  The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979.",

This act resulted in a forced migration of most of the Cherokee people to present-day Oklahoma known as the Cherokee removal. At the council grounds, the Cherokee made multiple unsuccessful pleas to the U.S. government to be allowed to remain in their ancestral homeland. The site is considered sacred to the Cherokees, and includes the Blue Hole Spring, a large hydrological spring. It is also listed as an interpretive center along the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.\nAfter the Cherokee removal, the site became private land, and was primarily used for agriculture. In the later part of the 20th century, a group of local historians undertook an effort to preserve and protect the site and turn it into a state park. The site was named to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1972, and Red Clay State Park opened to the public in 1979. It encompasses 263 acres (1.06 km2) of land immediately north of the Tennessee\u2013Georgia state line, and consists of a museum, replicas of Cherokee structures that once stood on the site, and three hiking trails, along with other amenities.",

It was part of the company town, with modest cottages for the miners and their families as well as a school, recreation center, firehouse and other public buildings, that CF&I president John Cleveland Osgood, had spent lavishly to create along with  his nearby estate. The mines were closed in 1908, and the village nearly abandoned, the dormitory among them. Most of its original buildings were demolished or moved, but the dormitory survived, and was restored and converted to its current use in mid-century.",

Jupiter-C launched to test components for the Jupiter missile.  Juno I put the first American satellite Explorer 1 into orbit. Mercury Redstone carried the first American astronaut Alan Shepard into space.  The Redstone earned the name \"Old Reliable\" because of this facility and the improvements it made possible.The Interim Test Stand was built in 1953 by Dr. Wernher von Braun's team for a mere US$25,000 (equivalent to $273,445 in 2022) out of materials salvaged from the Redstone Arsenal.  In 1957 the permanent test facility called the Static Test Tower was finally finished, but the Army decided to continue operations at the Interim Test Stand rather than move.  From 1953 to 1961, 362 static rocket tests were conducted there, including 200 that led directly to improvements in the Redstone rocket for the Mercury manned flight program.  Adapted over the years, it never experienced the growth in size and cost that typified test stands in general, remaining a testament to the engineering ingenuity of the rocket pioneers.",

Located west of Elizabethtown in Hamilton County, the site is composed of one Native American mound and the remnants of two others, spread out over an area of 40 acres (16 ha).The central part of the district is the Rennert Mound (also known as the \"Minnie Rennert Mound\"), which retains its original shape despite digging by locals in the past.  Because the mound has never been excavated professionally, no significant artifacts have been recovered from it; consequently, the culture of the builders is unknown.  The surrounding field has yielded plentiful lithic cores of white and tan chert, but too few cores have been found to justify classification of the fields as a village site.:\u200a120\u200a  Due to its location and shape, the mound is believed to have been built by Adenan or Hopewellian peoples, both of which typically buried many bodies and large numbers of grave goods within mounds of this size.  Another mound was once located approximately 90 feet (27 m) to the west, but it has been destroyed.  The preservation of the one mound despite the destruction of the other is likely due to recent intervention: in the early twentieth century, landowner John Rennert planted trees all around this mound to preserve it, but he made no such efforts around the other mounds.:\u200a120\u200aThree mounds once composed the Rennert complex, but neither of the others can be distinguished from the surrounding landscape; however, it is believed that an archaeological investigation might be able to discover their locations.

        "long_description": "Reservoir Park is a historic park on Boylston Street in Brookline, Massachusetts.  Its principal feature is Brookline Reservoir, formerly an element of the public water supply for neighboring Boston.  The reservoir was built in 1848 as the main terminus of the now-defunct Cochituate Aqueduct, which delivered water from Lake Cochituate in the western suburbs.  The reservoir covers 21.1 acres (8.5 ha), and is roughly kidney-shaped.  A gravel path extends around the perimeter of the reservoir.  The park is bounded on the north by Boylston Street (Massachusetts Route 9), on the west by Lee Street, on the south by Dudley Street, and on the east by Warren and Walnut Streets.There are two structures in the park.  At the western end of the reservoir stands the Influent Gatehouse, the endpoint of the Cochituate Aqueduct.  This is a modest utilitarian structure built out of dressed granite, about 11 feet (3.4 m) by 12 feet (3.7 m) and 11 feet in height.  Its interior houses equipment for managing the flow of water from the aqueduct into the reservoir.  The Principal Gatehouse, in contrast, is a more elaborate structure.  It is located at the northeastern end of the reservoir, and is a two-story building partially buried in the embankment.  It is built, like the Influent Gatehouse, of dressed granite, but was designed to be a public space.  Its main facade has Renaissance Revival elements within a Greek-style temple front.  The corners of the building have quoins in a paler shade of stone, and there is a course of that same stone in between the two floors.  It has a gabled roof with a fully pedimented gable end, decorated with dentil stonework.  The facade is three bays wide, with a centered entry on the lower level.  The entry is recessed behind an arch that is flanked by round columns supporting an entablature.  The entry is flanked by small elongated round-arch windows.  The upper level consists of three larger equal-sized round-arch windows.  The upper level of the building also has a facade facing the water; this also has three round-arch windows.Because the Principal Gatehouse was intended as a public space, its interior was also finished, unlike that of the Influent Gatehouse.  The walls were plastered, and there were stairs, constructed of wrought iron, which were used to reach a platform giving a view of the water.  These staircases are believed to the oldest surviving example of wrought iron stairs intended for public use in the United States.  (They are predated by surviving stairs in lighthouses and a prison, and by public stairs in other countries.)  The building's roof is also believed to be the only surviving period roof supported by wrought iron trusses.The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.  The architectural significance of the gatehouse and its status as the best-preserved element of the Cochituate Aqueduct were recognized in its designation as a National Historic Landmark in 2015.",

One of the earliest examples of industrial architecture in Tennessee, the mill operated variously from its construction around 1830 until the 1950s.  The mill was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in the 1970s.  Efforts to restore the mill began in 1980, but before the restoration could be completed, the mill was destroyed by arson in 1991.The Lenoir Cotton Mill was one of several enterprises established by early settler and entrepreneur William Ballard Lenoir (1775\u20131852).  Lenoir moved to the area in 1810 after his father, General William Lenoir, deeded to him the 5,000-acre (2,000 ha) tract of land comprising what is now Lenoir City.  The younger Lenoir established the Lenoir Manufacturing Company in 1817, which engaged in multiple agricultural and industrial enterprises throughout the 19th century.  The cotton mill was completed in the early 1830s and gradually expanded in subsequent decades.  During the U.S. Civil War, Union soldiers destroyed parts of the estate of the Confederate-leaning Lenoir family, but spared the mill due to William Ballard Lenoir's son Benjamin's Mason affiliations.  After the Lenoir family sold the mill in the 1890s, it operated variously as a hosiery mill and later as a flour mill.",

It includes the 1838 Greek Revival First Congregational Church, the town hall, whose present form was achieved in 1895 by raising the 1845 construction and building a first floor underneath it, and the Colonial Revival Field Memorial Library (1916).  It also includes a town pound (a stone-walled pen for stray livestock) built c. 1822, and a number of 18th century residences.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.Leverett was first settled in the late 17th century as part of Sunderland, and was separately incorporated in 1774.  Its town center, located at the junction of Depot, Montague, and Shutesbury Roads, arose by the placement there of the community's first meeting house not long after incorporation.  The oldest surviving residences in the center date to about 1750.  Its single largest period of growth lasted until about 1830, which included construction of the town's first school c. 1800 (94 Depot Road), and the town pound.  Modest growth continued in the mid-19th century, when a railroad line was run nearby.  This provided the impetus for some small-scale industrial activity, evidence of which survives in a single modest wood-frame factory building.",

It is the second public cemetery in Covington, the city's first public burial ground being Craig Street Cemetery, which dates to 1815. Craig Street Cemetery closed in 1872. Most of the bodies were moved to Linden Grove.\nTrustees of the nearby Western Baptist Theological Institute which was formed to train Baptist ministers founded the cemetery in 1842, and from the beginning allowed burials without regard to race or religion. The Western Baptist Theological Institute had been formed in 1833 to train Baptist ministers and at one time its grounds covered several hundred acres.\nSome accounts say burials at Linden Grove began in 1842, but the Licking Valley Register reported on September 9, 1843, that elaborate plans had been proposed for dedicating \"this beautiful spot of ground\" on September 11. Plans called for music and talks by ministers and groups from Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist churches in Covington.\nThe writer described Linden Grove as about \"60 acres of high table land, overlooking the city of Cincinnati and situated in the midst of the most quiet and romantic scenery.\" The newspaper reporter concluded, \"A place like this, in the vicinity of Cincinnati, would be thronged with the admirers of nature and art thus happily combined.\" A later account said a large crowd attended the dedication ceremonies.\nAs early as May 1851, The Covington Journal was cautioning lot owners to get more involved in the operation of the cemetery and warned that indifference was sure to lead to problems. Another Covington Journal account on May 1, 1858, noted that since its opening, Linden Grove had had more than 2,000 burials. Especially heavy years were 1850 and 1851, when cholera swept through the area. Those years there were more than 260 burials, compared to 160 in most other years.\nVandalism had become enough of a problem by 1859 that newspaper advertisements were run in the Covington Journal warning of fines of $5 to $50 for damaging grave sites. By 1868, Covington Journal accounts said another public burial site might soon be needed for Covington. The December 26 story said the Craig Street site had been full for several years and Linden Grove was quickly filling up. Highland Cemetery in Fort Mitchell would later be dedicated on June 26, 1869, to handle those needs.\nAlben Barkley, the former Vice President and U.S. senator, was the guest speaker at the 1953 Memorial Day ceremonies at Linden Grove. The Norman-Barnes Post of the American Legion served as Barkley's escort during the ceremonies. That Covington post later sponsored placement of a marker dedicated to Civil War veterans buried at Linden Grove.\nAmong those moved to Linden Grove was Thomas Kennedy, one of the founders of Covington. The cemetery's residents also include three former Northern Kentucky congressmen, including John G. Carlisle, namesake of an elementary school in Covington; William Wright Southgate; John W. Menzies; and William Evans Arthur. \n\nLinden Grove is the resting place of many Civil War veterans, including eighteen in colored units of the United States Army. Union and Confederate soldiers are buried facing each other in uniform rows. Two monuments to the war, the Veteran's Monument in Covington and the GAR Monument in Covington, are inside the cemetery, and like the cemetery, are on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe cemetery has been in receivership for half a century, with the city and Kenton County charged with overseeing it.\nOn September 8, 2006, the Kentucky Governor's Office of Local Development announced a grant of $23,863.00, to be combined with $44,000.00 from the City of Covington, $22,000.00 from the Kenton County Fiscal Court and $5,500.00 from the Cemetery. These monies will be used for new fencing on West 13th Street and Linden Avenue.\nIn 2003, $25,000 from the Cemetery Preservation Fund and $85,000 in local money was used to replace fencing along Kavanaugh Street.",

Some of its more distinctive components are Neoclassical, including its three-part facade and some of its smaller details.  Twelve stories tall, the building has been modified to include room for modern-styled shops on its first two floors; the main entrance is located in a recessed area to the right (from the perspective of someone inside the building) of the shop space.\nIt was renovated to new apartments as part of the city block revitialation of the Dayton Arcade.\nBuilt for Theodore Lindsey, the Lindsey Building was constructed in 1917 at a time when Dayton was highly prosperous.  During the late 1910s, the downtown was experiencing sustained growth, and numerous commercial buildings such as the Lindsey were being constructed.  For much of its history, it has housed financial institutions, including the Miami Savings and Loan Company and the Mutual Home and Savings Association.In 1985, the Lindsey Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; by the early 2010s, it was one of approximately one hundred such locations in the city of Dayton.

At the time of Linwood's development they owned virtually all of the textile industry in Northbridge.  The Linwood property was built to process cotton, and produced cambrics, sateens, and shirting fabric.  The original mill was a 3+1\u20442-story brick structure, which was expanded c. 1870 with the addition of a steam power plant in order to increase production.  From the 1870s, the only other surviving building is a brick storehouse.The mill complex, in addition to industrial facilities, also included worker housing.  The district includes the fine Second Empire proprietor's residence, carriage house, and greenhouse, as well as a selection of tenement houses, dormitories, and duplexes built by the Whitins to house the factory workers.

Elizabeth Wemett of the Lord family sold the property to Berkeley Heights in 1975.The farmstead property, all of which is owned by the township of Berkeley Heights, includes the main farmhouse, an adjacent Victorian annex in the Carpenter Gothic style (which served as a schoolhouse in the 1870s), a stone spring house, a summer kitchen, and 18 acres of farm and forest land.",

        "long_description": "The Little Theatre, commonly known as \"The Little\", is a movie theatre located on historic East Avenue in downtown Rochester, New York, and a modest non-profit multiplex specializing in art film, including independent and foreign productions outside the United States.\nFounded in 1929, The Little is one of the oldest active movie theaters built specifically to show films in the US, serving as an alternative venue for cinema of higher artistic caliber than what was popular at the time. To remain in business, The Little has created a unique theater experience for its patrons strikingly different from that of standard commercial cinemas. The Little typically shows films that never make it to the large theater chains, either due to lack of publicity, popularity, exposure, or content that is too risky and/or inappropriate for larger audiences (such as NC-17 rated films).  Foreign films, independent films, some documentary films and art films are its common fare.\nThe Little is unique in the area in treating anime films as artistic cinema, and titles by the likes of Hayao Miyazaki always find their way to The Little's screens. Critics at The Little provide a synopsis of any film they intend to show, both on their website and posted around their ticket booths on the street.\nThe Little also offers live musical performances from local musicians, a rotating art gallery of local artists, and a cafe. Additionally, The Little serves as a performance venue during the Rochester International Jazz Festival each June. The Little is also the home of the Little Theatre Film Society, a group of theater aficionados in the Rochester area. The Little survives largely due to the hard work and dedication of the society's members. The theater is currently operated with the participation of the WXXI Public Broadcasting Council, a non-profit community organization which owns and operates the region's principal public radio and television stations.\nThe Little has become part of Rochester's extensive theater culture. Rochester has a rich history in cinema, being the home of the Eastman Kodak company and the George Eastman Museum. Kodak film was historically used in a majority of motion pictures (and still is today), creating close ties to the movie industry in Rochester society. The Little Theatre Film Society holds film festivals throughout the year, many of them hosted at The Little. The theatre is well known by any serious cinema patron in Rochester for providing an alternative to standard Hollywood commercial fare. The Little has also avoided the negative reputation for snobbishness that is sometimes associated with art house cinema, cultivating the image of a venue for anyone who is simply seeking an alternative or a community that celebrates cinema.The word \"Theatre\" is often used instead of the word \"Theater\" to distinguish between art house cinemas and the more common variety. Theatre is an older form of the word, though both words share the same literal meaning. The Little uses the older form both to make this distinction and due to the age of the theater itself.",

        "name": "West Luther Valley Lutheran Church",
        "short_description": "church building in Wisconsin, United States of America",
        "long_description": "West Luther Valley Lutheran Church is a historic church built in 1871 in the Norwegian immigrant farm community southwest of Orfordville, Wisconsin on West Church Rd. In 1980 the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a remnant of that Norwegian community and for its association with the prominent Rev. Claus Clausen.The first Norwegian immigrants in the area then called Rock Prairie arrived in 1839. In 1844 Pastor Claus Lauritz Clausen visited from Muskego and conducted services for his Norwegian brethren in Skavlem's stone house. A congregation formed and they called Clausen to be their pastor. He arrived in 1846 and gave half his salary toward building the first Luther Valley Church - a stone building 28 by 44 feet, furnished with a home-made altar, pews, baptismal font and pulpit. Meetings of Norwegian Lutheran leaders from the upper Midwest were held at this East church in 1851 and 1853 at which the Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was organized. Luther College was also planned here, at a meeting in 1861.Clausen stepped down as pastor in 1851 and switched to publishing Norwegian language newspapers out of a stone print shop near the East Church: the church paper Maanedstidende and the secular paper Emigranten. He also served as superintendent of the Norwegian Synod from 1851 to 1852. In 1853 Clausen went to Iowa, but returned from time to time to conduct services. Clausen served as chaplain of the 15th Wisconsin Regiment in the Civil War and in 1861 led a church faction that declared slavery a sin. In 1868 he resigned from the Norwegian Synod over the matter. He eventually joined the Norwegian-Danish Conference, as did the Luther Valley church.By 1871 the Luther Valley congregation had outgrown its stone church, and built two frame church buildings: the East Luther Valley Church on the site of the stone church, and the West Luther Valley Church which is the subject of this article. The west church was added as a branch congregation for the convenience of families that lived out that way. Both churches were built by Anders Bjornstad, born at Toten, Norway. The head carpenter of the west church was Jesse Woodward.The West Church was a modest, fairly typical country church - a frame structure clad in white clapboard on a limestone foundation, with four tall windows with clear glass on each side. Above the front entry was a square tower supporting a smaller square belfry. Inside, a choir loft spanned above the front entry. When the West church was built in 1871, the old church furniture from the East church was moved there, including the altar with a locally made reredos, the railings, pulpit, baptismal font, wooden pews, and two \"pens\" for the pastor's assistants. These furnishings were probably present in the East church for the meetings that formed the Norwegian Synod.The church changed over the years. A kitchen wing was added, probably around 1900. The enclosed porch was added around 1907. About 1950 the congregation added a basement and furnace under the church, a drop ceiling in the nave along with wallpaper and paneling, and they replaced the clear glass windows with colored glass.Some Norwegian language services continued into the 1950s. In 1966 the West Church joined the Wisconsin Synod and renamed itself Bethany Church.",

It is a two-story, octagonal house of stacked plank construction, featuring an 8-sided roof topped by an octagonal \"captains walk,\" flanked by two brick chimneys.  The house has a simplified Federal style.  It was built about 1854, and served as summer home for the Jewett family until 1874.\nWildfell is one of the rare octagonal houses built in Maryland at the height of the \"Octagon Fad\". Located in Darlington, Maryland just off US 1, the house is a prominent feature of Harford County.Construction is believed to have begun in 1847 with completion prior to 1854.  Commissioned by the Joseph Jewett family of Baltimore, Maryland and built by William Hensel. The Jewett family learned of an abandoned Baltimore clipper ship which had served in the War of 1812.  The Jewett family purchased the derelict and contracted Hensel (a former naval carpenter) to salvage wood from the vessel and transport materials to the building site in Darlington, MD.   The short oak timbers and naval treated planks were well suited to the short walls required by the octagonal design.  The interior layout resembles an octagon divided into quadrants.  Thus, most rooms have 5 walls.\nTwo stories high, the octagonal house has an 8-sided roof topped by an octagonal \"widows walk\" flanked by two brick chimneys which serviced 4 fireplaces in the primary living areas and a hearth in the basement. The house faces southeast, with one or two openings in each wall. A modern one-story wing (constructed 2011, replaced ca.1900 structure) runs northwest. There is a three-sided porch facing east, southeast, and south.\nWildfell is a simplified Federal style, with a molding over the boxed eaves, which is repeated on the porch above its octagonal pillars. The six-paneled front door in a plain frame is topped by a four-light transom. Windows have 6/6 lights behind louvered shutters. The stairway has two turned balusters on each step under a walnut handrail. Double parlors are separated by pocket doors.  Original kitchen and dining room spaces are to the rear.\nPerhaps unique to this house are the exterior and interior load bearing walls whose construction is of narrow (1\u201dx7\u201d) oak planks laid horizontally, nailed from above as the work proceeded, forming a virtually solid 7\u201d wall thickness. The construction method is visible beneath the shutters of the false windows to the left of the front door.  The window placement would have opened out from the side of the staircase, but is placed to complete the symmetrical appearance of the house.  Floor joists are hand hued timber beams set in a cross pattern and cross joined by lesser beams.\nThe Jewetts used Wildfell as a summer home from March 1854 until June 1874.  The property was sold in 1874 and it came into ownership by the prominent Scott family where it remained for several generations.\nWildfell is listed on the National Register of Historic Places September 20, 1973.The property is currently owned by Matthew and Bonnie Payne.",

The locks were operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and served primarily pleasure boats. Passage through the locks was free for both commercial and recreational vessels. The locks were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and designated as an Oregon Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1991.The locks comprise seven gates in four chambers which lift up to 50 feet (15 m) elevation change (depending on tides and river flow) with a usable width of 37 feet (11 m).

Blount, a Founding Father of the United States, a signer of the United States Constitution, and a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, lived on the property with his family and ten African-American slaves.  The mansion served as the de facto capitol of the Southwest Territory.  In 1796, much of the Tennessee Constitution was drafted in Governor Blount's office at the mansion.  Tennessee state historian John Trotwood Moore once called Blount Mansion \"the most important historical spot in Tennessee.\"The house is a wood-frame home sheathed in wood siding, built with materials brought from North Carolina in an era when most homes in Tennessee were log cabins.  The two-story central portion of the home is the oldest section.  The one-story west wing is believed to have been constructed next; archaeologists suspect the west wing was originally an outbuilding, which was then moved and attached to the main house, and there is some evidence the west wing was originally the servants' quarters. The one-story east wing was the final section to be constructed, perhaps as late as 1820.  Blount's office, from which he governed and conducted his business affairs, was built along with the house and is a one-story, free-standing building and had a modest front porch.\nBy 1925, the house had deteriorated, and a local developer, B.H. Sprankle, intended to demolish it and replace it with a parking lot to serve the new Andrew Johnson Hotel, then under construction. The Blount Mansion Association was chartered the following year, and after a massive publicity campaign by Mary Boyce Temple and the Bonnie Kate Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the East Tennessee Historical Society, the Association raised enough money to purchase the house in 1930.  The Blount Mansion Association has since maintained the house as a museum, and has made numerous renovations to restore the house and property to its late 18th-century appearance.  In the 1960s, the mansion was designated a National Historic Landmark.",

It is a 1+1\u20442-story, five-by-two-bay, frame residence faced in shingles and clapboards.  It has a center stone chimney. The rear kitchen wing and 1-story north wing were added about 1800 and the house given its saltbox configuration. In the mid-19th century, the present porch was added with its Doric order piers and a 1-story, gable-roofed wing added.  Also on the property are a carriage house, former slave quarters, and a storage building / corn crib.  The property was purchased by the village in 1925 from the Bush estate. It served as headquarters for General Israel Putnam, 1777\u20131778.It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.History of the Homestead : The home may have been built by John Lyon II, born 1693, who had considerable farm land that included the area now called Lyon Park. There is considerable evidence that the house existed before the marriage of his daughter Ruth Lyon to Abraham Bush, who made the house their homestead. It may have been occupied by one or more of John Lyon II's sons.\nJohn Lyon II's children were: John Lyon (1713-1790); Roger Lyon (1715-1797); Elizabeth (Lyon) Treadwell (1718-1772); James Lyon (1720-1804);  Ruth Lyon (1724-1802).\nRuth Lyon and Abraham Bush were married c.1744. They had seven children, all born at the house between 1747 and 1766. Their son Gilbert Bush (1753-1831) married Sabrina Seymour and had one daughter Mary Emeline Bush (born about 1799, died 1893), who inherited the house. Emeline married Gershom Bulkley of Port Chester, from a family of sea merchants in the area. They had seven children born in the house, all of whom pre-deceased Mary Emeline. Upon her death, questions arose as to the ownership and preservation of the home, and after a series of court hearings involving distance relatives, the house and property were purchased by the Village of Port Chester in 1925 and preserved as a park. The Port Chester Historical Society maintains its headquarters at the homestead and welcomes any visitors to tour the homestead when the homestead is open to the public.",

The C & H Refinery is noted as the smallest functioning oil refinery in the world, and may be the only remaining thermal distillation refinery, all other refineries having modernized to the catalytic cracking method.The refinery processed oil produced at the Lance Creek Oil Field, which produced a paraffin-based high gravity \"sweet\" (low-sulfur) oil that could easily be processed through simple means. The Ohio Oil Company controlled the field and piped its product to markets in the U.S. Midwest. A part-time Ohio Oil employee, Roy Chamberlain, obtained permission to use oil from the Lance Creek pipeline and refine it. Using salvaged equipment from the defunct Pennsylvanian Belgo-American Refinery in Casper, Chamberlain and his partner James Hoblit built their refinery in 1933 in Lusk on a 1.5 acres (0.61 ha) site. Some of the equipment used by the C & H had been made as early as 1886.Chamberlain sold his interest to Hoblit in 1935 and used the proceeds to buy the Ranger Hotel in Lusk. He went on to be elected state senator and founded the Ranger Oil Company.  Hoblitt and his family retained the refinery until 1974.The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.",

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.The Kensington Park subdivision was laid out in 1890 on land belonging to a number prominent local families.  A syndicate of Boston and Cambridge businessmen funded the development, which was marketed as providing fresh air, and a number of modern amenities such as piped water and paved roads.  The houses they built were large and predominantly Colonial Revival in styling, although other popular styles of the period, including Shingle, Craftsman, and Queen Anne, are represented in the surviving houses.

        "long_description": "Kingsley Plantation (also known as the Zephaniah Kingsley Plantation Home and Buildings) is the site of a former estate on Fort George Island, in Duval County, Florida, that was named for its developer and most famous owner, Zephaniah Kingsley, who spent 25 years there. It is located at the northern tip of Fort George Island at Fort George Inlet, and is part of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve managed by the U.S. National Park Service. Kingsley's house is the oldest plantation house still standing in Florida, and the solidly-built village of slave cabins is one of the best preserved in the United States. It is also \"the oldest surviving antebellum Spanish Colonial plantation in the United States.\"The plantation originally occupied the entirety of Fort George Island, described variously as occupying 713, 720, or \"750 acres [300 ha] more or less\". According to park literature, most of it has been taken back over by forest; the structures and grounds of the park now comprise approximately 60 acres (24 ha). Evidence of pre-Columbian Timucua life is on the island, as are the remains of a Spanish mission named San Juan del Puerto. Under British rule in 1765, a plantation was established that cycled through several owners while Florida was transferred back to Spain and then the United States. The longest span of ownership was under Kingsley and his family, a polygamous and multiracial household controlled by and resistant to the issues of race and slavery.\nThe principal business at the Kingsley Plantation was slaves: buying, selling, and training them. Kingsley's slaves commanded a premium in the market. Raising salable cotton was a secondary business. As they were very isolated they also had to raise their food, in small gardens. By the standards of the day Kingsley treated his slaves well \u2014he married one\u2014, and they were loyal to him.\nFree blacks and several private owners lived at the plantation until it was purchased by the State of Florida in 1955. It was acquired by the National Park Service in 1991.\nThe most prominent features of Kingsley Plantation are the owner's house\u2014a structure of architectural significance built probably between 1797 and 1798 that is cited as being the oldest surviving plantation house in the state\u2014and an attached kitchen house, barn, and remains of 25 anthropologically valuable slave cabins that endured beyond the U.S. Civil War (1861\u20131865). The foundations of the house, kitchen, barn, and the slave quarters were constructed of durable tabby concrete. Archeological evidence found in and around the slave cabins has given researchers insight into African traditions among slaves who had recently arrived in North America.\nZephaniah Kingsley wrote a defense of slavery and the three-tier social system that acknowledged the rights of free people of color that existed in Florida under Spanish rule. Kingsley briefly served on the Florida Territorial Council.\nKingsley Plantation was not Kingsley's only or even his primary plantation. His plantation on Drayton Island has not been studied. \"At the other end of Fort George, now Batten Island, he built himself a house of some size, which is now [1878] in ruins; there lived Flora, his black mistress. He divided his time about equally between the two places.\":\u200a845\u200a \"In the 1830 census he owned only 39 slaves at the present Fort George site, but 188 at a little-known San Jos\u00e9 plantation, in Nassau County.:\u200a69\u200a In 1836 he moved his entire family from Florida, since Kingsley's free Blacks were ever more unwelcome and insecure, to a plantation called Mayorasgo de Koka, at the time in Haiti but from the 1840s in the Dominican Republic. Little remains of Mayorasgo de Koka.",

There are around 80 fieldstones with no carving or identification, but it is unknown if this stems from wearing of the gneiss stone or that there were no skilled carvers locally available. The seven carvers that have been identified are Lebbeus Kimball, Jotham Warren, Josiah Manning, Peter Barker, Mr. Huntington of Lebanon, E. Marston of Mystic Bridge and O. Doty of Stonington. The National Historic Register of Places nomination notes, \"the cemetery is significant artistically because the carving on the stones gives many good examples of the funerary art that was characteristic of the 18th and 19th centuries in New England.\" The cemetery is notable because of the burial of Isaac C. Glasko, the namesake of the village of Glasgo, and a prominent African American land-holding man who ran a blacksmith shop that was important to the marine industry of the area. The cemetery was made a part of the Connecticut Freedom Trail in 1995 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 12, 2001.",

The pavilion was originally located on the grounds of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in Nashville which was held in 1897. It was purchased after the exposition and moved by wagon to its present location off Highway 96. The building is of Neo-Classical design and features a prominent red dome.

The pavilion was part of the Centennial complex and after the Exposition came to an end it was purchased and moved to Williamson County. The house has Colonial Revival detailing and a prominent central projecting dome. The house has not been altered and is one of the most unusual designs in the county. (page 43)",

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.An earlier county courthouse stood on the southeast corner of the same lot since 1861 - a three-story stone building. By 1900 more space was needed. Matt Murphy of Benton, Wisconsin was the remaining trustee of a fund to care for widows and others affected by the Civil War. The fund was not needed after the federal government took responsibility for those affected by the war, and after exploring other options, Murphy dedicated it to help build the new 1905 courthouse. Along with the Civil War survivors' fund, Murphy gave 70% of his own estate to the county for a courthouse. Ultimately, the cost of building the courthouse was more than $136,000. It is the only county courthouse in the United States to be fully funded by one person.The building was designed in Neoclassical style by Menno S. Detweiler and Frank W. Kinney of Minneapolis. The main block of the building is three stories tall, clad in buff limestone, with rusticated quoins. The main entrance protrudes as a distyle in antis Greek temple form, with a relief sculpture of Matt Murphy in the pediment. The roof is hipped. From the center rises the cupola. The first stage has Ionic columns between windows topped with clock faces. The second stage of the cupola is octagonal, topped with copper.Inside, light from a skylight in the cupola illuminates the center of the building, with marble wainscoting, hexagonal tiles, arches, and murals depicting Justice, Equality, Courage and Liberty.Scenes from the 2009 film Public Enemies were filmed at the courthouse.",

There are art galleries, stores selling souvenirs, gifts, custom jewelry, pottery, and imported Mexican folk art, as well as several restaurants in the district. La Villita connects to the San Antonio River Walk and its outdoor venue, the Arneson River Theatre. It is close to the Alamo, the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, Rivercenter Mall, and HemisFair Park. It is within walking distance of most downtown hotels.\nLocated on the south bank of the San Antonio River, La Villita was one of San Antonio's first neighborhoods. In 1939, as ground broke on the San Antonio River Walk development, city officials led by Mayor Maury Maverick acted to preserve this part of San Antonio's history. It was a Native American settlement and then a collection of primitive brush huts, called jacales, for the Spanish soldiers (and their Indian wives and children) stationed nearby at the Mission San Antonio de Valero (an active mission from about 1718 to 1793, now better known as the Alamo). After a flood in 1819 washed away most of the huts, more substantial adobe houses replaced them.\nLate in the 19th century, European immigrants from Germany, France, and Italy moved into the area and soon became active in business and trades: retailers, bankers, educators, and craftsmen. The variety of architectural styles seen in La Villita's buildings reflects the cultural mix, from the one-room homes of the poor to the larger houses of the prosperous.La Villita deteriorated into a slum in the early part of the 20th century. During the Great Depression, work began on the River Walk, a make-work project funded by the Works Progress Administration which came close to La Villita. The project, led by Mayor Maury Maverick, sponsored a companion effort in 1939 by the National Youth Administration to restore and preserve this colorful part of San Antonio's history. The NYA offered classes in arts and crafts as part of its program.\nToday La Villita is an arts community, and is included in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Bexar County, Texas. The galleries and shops found in one city block offer art by local and regional artists featuring oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, metal art, rock art, textiles, copperwares, pottery, jewelry, stained glass, and regional folk art.\nDuring four nights of the Fiesta San Antonio each April, La Villita is host to a  Night in Old San Antonio with dozens of booths grouped to offer fifteen areas for various kinds of food, such as Sauerkraut Bend, China Town, Irish Flat, and the Mexican Market. The outdoor festival, with its narrow streets decorated with paper flowers and papel picado (cut paper banners), typically attracts 85,000 celebrants, many wearing costumes and unusual hats. The event is a major fundraiser for the San Antonio Conservation Society.\n\n",

From many accounts, LaBranche Plantation in St. Rose, Louisiana, was one of the grandest on the German Coast until it was destroyed during the American Civil War. All that remained was the dependency house, known as a garconni\u00e8re (French for bachelor quarters).\nThe dependency was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was deemed to have \"statewide significance in the area of architecture as a rare and superior example of the Creole style.\" Further:The importance of the dependency rests upon its elaborate and pretentious detailing. Both its beams and ceiling boards are beaded, which alone makes it superior to numerous other surviving examples of the Creole style. Beyond this, it has high quality mantels which are very unexpected on a house so small. With their strong moldings, elaborate sunburst motifs, and complex engaged balusters, the dependency's mantels are commensurate with those of a major Creole plantation house. Most Creole houses the size of the LaBranche Dependency were built as plantation houses in their own right and had the relatively plain styling appropriate to a smaller Creole house. But the LaBranche Dependency was built as an ancillary building to a plantation house of the first rank and was styled accordingly. Very few if any comparable dependencies survive in Louisiana. Hence the LaBranche Dependency is undoubtedly one of the state's most richly and impressively styled smaller Creole houses. It is also significant as a rare example of a residential plantation dependency from the early nineteenth century.",

Meteorological observations were made there from the time the building opened using recording weather instruments.In addition to general astronomy courses it was also used for teaching civil engineering topics such as geodesy. Nautical science subjects, including celestial navigation, were taught there during the First World War.Ladd began a regular schedule of open nights for public viewing in 1930. This led to the creation of the Skyscrapers amateur astronomy society in 1932 which regularly met at Ladd. The Skyscrapers then acquired the Seagrave Observatory in 1936 which was then used as a meeting place. Amateur astronomers from the group continued to volunteer at Ladd and also participated in Brown University solar eclipse expeditions. Members constructed a Schmidt camera for the 1937 Brown eclipse expedition.Ladd was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It continues to be used by the Department of Physics at Brown for astronomy instruction. It is regularly open to the public as a science center and technology museum.",

It is an unusual combination of different architectural styles.The company was created in 1863 when the city bought new fire engines for the Niagara and Cataract companies. This forced the Neptune Company out of business, and it was accordingly reorganized as the Lady Washington. The firehouse was built in 1908.Local architect Percival M. Lloyd was hired to design the building, and he in turn subcontracted the construction to the O'Donnell Construction Company, another local firm. The resulting structure has a yellow brick facade. A corbelled soffit holds the Japanese-style tiled roof. A small wing shows signs of a Gothic Revival influence with its castellated roofline. The facade's second story is dominated by a hanging bay window. The soffit, bay window and single garage door at street level are currently painted a bright green in contrast with the facade.The interior is largely intact. The Japanese influence on the roof continues with its supporting rafters visible.After the city's fire department absorbed the company, the building was reused as a warehouse by the Southeastern New York Library Council. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, one of three of the city's former firehouses so listed (the other two are the O. H.

It was expanded in 1922 by adding a wing that gave the stricture a U-shaped plan.The building has a 2-story annex that is not included in the NRHP listing.In 1954 a satellite studio of Hutchinson-based television station KTVH opened in the building.  This was the first television station to open that covered Wichita, the state's largest city. KTVH's attempts to provide service to Wichita, in what would become a running theme in the first three decades of station history, rankled the stations licensed there. KAKE radio and television petitioned the FCC in November 1954 to order KTVH to stop identifying as a \"Wichita station\"; it declined to do so. In 1956, KTVH moved its Wichita facilities out of the Lassen and into quarters formerly used by the defunct KEDD.The hotel operated as the Lassen Motor Hotel until July 1, 1969, when it was renamed the Radisson Wichita Hotel.  In 1971, it was purchased by the Defenders of the Christian Faith and was operated as a retirement home with offices and retail space.  It was the subject of the Kansas Supreme Court case, Defenders of the Christian Faith v. Board of County Commissioners, 219 Kan. 181, 547 P.2d 706 (1976). In 1983, work began to convert the structure to an office building. By 1986, it was functioning as offices, renamed Market Centre.

Its congregation followed a particularly traditional branch of the German Brethren, and the services held there consisted of Scripture readings, commentary from a preacher, and prayer; the church resisted what it saw as modern developments such as church music and professional ministers. The church was also designed to host the communal love feast, a religious meal which formed an important part of the German Brethren faith; its basement includes a kitchen with a stone hearth.The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 1994.",

        "short_description": "canal in Massachusetts, United States of America",
        "long_description": "The South Hadley Canal was a canal along the Connecticut River in South Hadley, Massachusetts. It was the earliest navigable canal in the United States, with operation commencing in 1795. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the South Hadley Canal Historic District.\nThe canal dates to February 1792, when leading citizens of western Massachusetts proposed to build a canal around the Great Falls at South Hadley, a 53-foot (16 m) drop in the Connecticut River that blocked boat transport. At that time, all cargo needed to be unloaded for 2.5 miles (4.0 km) of land transport around the falls, driving river transport cost for a bushel of wheat from Northampton, Massachusetts, to Windsor, Connecticut, to more than double its transport costs by sea from Hartford to Boston. John Hancock, then Governor of Massachusetts, signed the charter which incorporated the Proprietors of the Locks and Canals on the Connecticut River. Their corporate seal bore the motto \"SIC TRANSIT - Public & Private Good\".\n\nFunds were raised both locally and internationally, with four Dutch investment houses owning slightly over 50% of the stock. The canal was built by some 240 local workers. In April 1795 it opened to commercial traffic. (Nearby Turners Falls Canal opened three years later.) First year revenue came to $3,109 at 75 cents per ton. By 1816 tolls had grown to over $16,000. In 1826 the Barnet, the first steamboat to operate on the Connecticut River, passed through the South Hadley Canal on its way to Vermont. However, by 1843 competing railroads had begun to erode income, and the canal closed as uneconomical in 1862.\nRather than use locks, the canal was built with an unusual \"inclined plane\" to transport 20-foot (6.1 m) by 60-foot (18 m) flatboats over the falls. The inclined plane appears to have been pioneered on England's Ketley Canal in 1788. This was its first use in American canals, and served as a pattern for others including the Morris Canal in New Jersey.\nOn the South Hadley Canal's inclined plane, the boat was first maneuvered into a special cart, then hauled up or down a ramp built of solid stone, 275 feet (84 m) long by 30 feet (9.1 m) wide, covered with strong wood planks, and having a slope of 13.5 degrees. Lifting power was supplied by two overshot waterwheels 16 feet (4.9 m) in diameter, one on each side of the inclined plane, connected to the cart with chains. The cart had unequal wheel sizes to keep the boat level during transport. Total transport time was about 15 minutes. In 1805, after about 10 years of use, however, the inclined plane was replaced by a series of five locks when it was necessary to deepen the canal.\nToday The Bicentennial Canal Park serves as a historic memorial, preserving the historical remnants of the canal. The overlook deck provides vistas of the Mount Tom Range and the Connecticut River. Holyoke Gas & Electric maintains Texon Park, Lower Riverside Park, and Gatehouse Park along the Holyoke dam. Lower Riverside Park overlooks the site of the former inclined plane and lock system, remnants of which are still visible today.",

The depot is a rectangular two-story, wood-frame building. The station agent lived in the second floor apartment.\n\nIn the 1890s the growth of Whittier caused the Southern Pacific Railroad to build a branch line from its main line in Santa Fe Springs, California. The depot was originally built at 11825 Bailey Street.  The branch served local citrus packing houses and a gas works. In the early 1900s, the Pacific Electric Railway built a branch line that paralleled the Southern Pacific track.\nWith the arrival of the automobile, passenger traffic on the Pacific Electric decreased, and in 1938 the Pacific Electric ceased service to Whittier.  The Southern Pacific then abandoned its tracks and took over the Pacific Electric tracks and extended them to the station.  The Southern Pacific continued providing freight train service to Whittier until 1967. From 1967 until the mid-1980s, the Southern Pacific Depot was occupied by various industrial tenants.\nOn July 1, 1978, the depot was first listed in the National Register of Historic Places.  In the mid-1980s, plans began to develop for the restoration and preservation of the depot. The City took possession of the depot and after several years of neglect, the city received a $1.2 million grant to restore and reuse the depot.  The depot was ultimately moved to 7333 Greenleaf Ave., near the Uptown Business District. Because of the move, the depot was removed from the National Register on October 1, 2004.

In 1958, the parcel of land on which the house sat was purchased by the Walworth Steel Company; rather than tearing the old house down, it was dismantled and moved approximately one mile down Washington Street to its present location. Roughly 60% of the timbers in the house are original, while the others have been replaced during restoration with materials appropriate to the late 18th century. The house is furnished to represent a middle-class agricultural household, like the Thayer family, in 1785\u20131793.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

It is an area of approximately 90 acres (36 ha) just east of Union College.\nOriginally an undeveloped tract owned by the college, it was sold to General Electric (GE) at the end of the 19th century to help the college pay off a debt. The company's executives subdivided it, laid out streets according to a plan inspired by New York's Central Park and built houses on the land, with covenants requiring a minimum lot size and house value. Two of them were among the first fully electric houses in the U.S., used as models by GE. Also settling in the neighborhood were some local businessmen and politicians, and the research scientists who worked at the company's research laboratory a short distance away. They were collectively responsible for over 400 patents. Some of the key events in their research happened within the Plot, as many took things home to work on.\nBy 1927 approximately a hundred houses had been built, including one later owned by chemist Irving Langmuir, a GE researcher, for his later life. It has subsequently been designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition of Langmuir's scientific accomplishments, including the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1980 the entire neighborhood was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe Plot is no longer so heavily dominated by GE employees, due to the company's greatly reduced presence in the city. Houses in it remain highly valued, and residents pay some of the Capital District region's highest property taxes. Rules enforced by both the neighborhood association and the city's Historic Commission preserve its historic character.\n\n",

In the 19th century, the church basement hosted a school where children from the area learned to read and write in German while also receiving religious education. The students were taught by Sisters of St. Agnes, whose order was founded in the Village of Barton, Wisconsin.\nOriginally, the inside of the church had whitewashed walls, but in 1925, the congregation commissioned Milwaukee artist Hans Schmeidl to paint a depiction of St. Augustine behind the altar, flanked by bordered medallion paintings of Mary and Jesus.\nSermons and hymns were in German into the 1940s.\nThe church stopped holding regular services in 1985, and the parishioners joined Holy Trinity Church in Newburg. From that point on, the building was used exclusively for holiday services, weddings, and funerals. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.",

St. Elmo became part of the city of Chattanooga when it was annexed in September 1929.\nHundreds of properties in the neighborhood were listed on the National Register in 1982, and in 1996 St. Elmo was designated a Local Historic District. Many of the buildings from the late 19th and early 20th century have been preserved.  A St. Elmo resident is an 'Elmoian'.",

The congregation was founded in 1767, meeting initially in a sail loft on Dock Street, and in 1769 it purchased the shell of a building which had been erected in 1763 by a German Reformed congregation.  At this time, Methodists had not yet broken away from the Anglican Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church was not founded until 1784.Richard Allen and Absalom Jones became the first African Americans licensed by the Methodist Church. They were licensed by St. George's Church in 1784. Three years later, protesting racial segregation in the worship services, Allen led most of the black members out of St. George's. Allen's camp founded the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church and the African Methodist Episcopal denomination, while Jones became an Episcopal priest, founding the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas.In the 1920s a court case saved the church from being demolished to make way for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.  The case resulted in the bridge being relocated.St. George's has experienced many changes during its 249-year history. From 100 members in 1769, the church grew to a peak membership of 3,200 congregants in 1835. The Civil War and industrialization changed the neighborhood; the congregation was reduced to 25 by 1900.\nToday the church is an active and vibrant Methodist congregation, tracing its roots back to its founding in 1769. The current pastor of St. George's is Reverend Mark Ignatius Salvacion, J.D. St. George's is one of the more than 500 churches in the Eastern PA Conference of the United Methodist Church (http://www.epaumc.org/).\nSt. George's is committed to a theology of love and inclusion, to personal transformation by faith, and to putting God's love to work in the community \u2013 the same core values as the first Methodists who met there. St. George's is also continuing with the ongoing work of reconciliation with African-American brothers and sisters for the racial injustices of the past.",

Mill Creek Hundred was split off from Christiana Hundred (as were nearby White Clay Hundred and Pencader Hundred) in 1710, and four years later James Robinson bought 110 acres, of which he donated 10 to build a church for the community. The building was finished two years later, and the first minister was George Ross, who later became father-in-law of the flagmaker Betsy Ross.  After the American Revolution, although few Anglican clergy remained in Delaware, a layman from this church attended the first General Convention that founded the Episcopal Church, along with Rev. Charles Henry Wharton (a converted Catholic and rector of nearby Immanuel Church, New Castle) and two other layman from that parish. In 1820, the wood-frame church burned, and was rebuilt in stone during the next three years.\nBishop William White consecrated the current church in 1821, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as St. James Church in 1973. A rounded apsidal chancel projects from the north wall, and the interior still has white box pews and a balcony on three sides. The oldest burial in the surrounding cemetery is of John Armstrong, who died in 1726. The cemetery also contains the graves of several identified veterans of the American Revolution (and a memorial concerning lost veterans' graves).",

As a result of the city's wealth, and with a need to house businesspeople and tourists visiting the city, eleven prominent businessmen invested in the construction of the hotel.  It opened with a grand ball on Thanksgiving Day, 1875.  It was one of the most elaborate hotels along the Mississippi River and served the city during its heyday as a commercial center and a steamboat stop.\nThe hotel was purchased in 1977 by the Red Wing Shoe Company and renovated.  It was also given two additions, a shopping courtyard and a new section for offices and hotel rooms.  Until recently, the hotel had 61 guest rooms, each with its own unique decoration and bearing the name of a riverboat that used to travel up and down the Mississippi River.

The current Greek Revival church was constructed in 1849 at a cost of $2,800 under the ministry of Reverend John Monteith, who was a graduate from the Princeton Theological Seminary. Monteith, along with Gabriel Richard, co-founded what would later become the University of Michigan.  Monteith served as the university's unofficial first president from 1817\u20131821 after having moved to the Michigan Territory in 1816.  He would later move to Blissfield and preach from 1845\u20131855.  During that time, he headed the funding for the construction of the church.  The building is the fifth oldest operating Presbyterian church in the state of Michigan and the oldest church in Blissfield.In 1883, the building itself was moved slightly to its current position just north of U.S. Route 223 near the River Raisin.  In 1953, a large addition was added to the church, which greatly changed the appearance of the original church structure.",

Efforts to preserve and restore Fort Concho began in the 1900s and resulted in the foundation of the Fort Concho Museum in 1929.

        "long_description": "Fort Duffield is a Union American Civil War fort located outside West Point, Kentucky. It saw use in 1862, and was abandoned when it appeared that the war would never come near the fort. Ironically, John Hunt Morgan would in 1863 lead his Raiders right past the fort and may have been stopped had the fort not been abandoned.\nWilliam Tecumseh Sherman was concerned with the Confederate positions in Bowling Green and Columbus, and sent the 37th Indiana and the 9th Michigan regiments to West Point. The plan was to use West Point as a Union supply base for Elizabethtown. Sherman ordered the fort to be built on Pearman Hill to protect the town and supply route.  Construction began on November 3, 1861, and was finished in two months. The fort was named for the Rev. George Duffield of Detroit, whose son, Colonel William W. Duffield, led the 9th Michigan Infantry. There were 950 troops stationed there, but they were soon sent to the front lines and the fort was mostly unused in 1862, seeing its last use that fall.\n\nThe fort is mostly a serpentine wall, unlike the typical star-shaped Civil War forts in Kentucky. The earthworks of the fort are well-preserved. Originally there was a one-mile clearing between the fort and any trees, but since the fort's abandonment the forest has grown back around the fort. A fresh water spring was located inside the fort.\n\nIn 1995 a team of volunteers led by Billy Morris and Dennis Wren started the clearing of overgrowth. By 1996 it was opened as a tourist attraction. You could catch a bus in the town of West Point and ride it to the top of the steep hill where there are wooden facilities and an information station showing a map of the fort and the different paths to take. The full tour of the fort included wooden walkways to the top where you could see small cabins built and tents where reenactors would do demonstrations. You could follow the path on to the lookout point that gives a clear view of the Ohio River and West Point. From there you were able to take a small pathway past the very natural spring that was used in the times of the Civil War. This trail took you back to the beginning of the wooden pathway and start of the walking tour by the information station and outhouses.\nAs of 2021 there are not any reenactments or bus rides currently but you can still hike the hill and follow the trails and pathways and see the little cabins. There is a bench to sit at the lookout point. However it's too dangerous to go by the natural spring so that has been excluded from the public trail. Volunteers from West Point Historical Society and the West Point Historical Museum including Mony Matthews and Chris Lueken help with the upkeep of the fort. There is also a Civil War cemetery on the west side of Fort Hill that has been updated with new grave markers and cleared out for visitors to experience. The bottom of Fort Hill has a parking lot and there are multiple biking trails that start right off the parking lot to take advantage of the beautiful area. Also there is a boat dock/camp ground to the left of the entrance off of Dixie hwy (31w) that puts you in to the Salt River.",

A double-track railway occupies the lower deck of the bridge, while two lanes of road traffic are carried on the upper deck. The bridge is about 1 mile (1.6 km) long with a swing span of 525 feet (160 m), and was the longest and largest double-deck swing-span bridge in the world when constructed in 1927. It replaced an inadequate combination roadway/single-track bridge completed in 1887. The main river crossing consists of four 270-foot (82 m) Baltimore through truss spans and a swing span made of two equal arms, 266 feet (81 m) long. In 1999, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places under the title, Fort Madison Bridge, ID number 99001035. It was also documented as survey number IA-62 by the Historic American Engineering Record, archived at the Library of Congress. Construction and photographic details were recorded at the time in Scientific American magazine.\nThe bridge is the western terminus of Illinois Route 9 which continues eastwards towards Canton, Illinois, about 80 miles (130 km), and Peoria, about 100 miles (160 km). Iowa Highway 2 formerly reached the bridge from the west. On July 26, 1927, operations were transferred from the original single-track bridge to the current double-track bridge. The first opening for river traffic occurred at 11:58 a.m. on July 26, 1927, for the scow C. W. Howell, traveling downriver with no barges attached.The bridge is privately owned by BNSF Railway and is the river crossing for the Southern Transcon, BNSF's Chicago\u2013Southern California main line. In 2022, between 40 and 100 trains crossed the bridge each day, including Amtrak's Southwest Chief. Amtrak's Fort Madison station is 2 miles (3.2 km) west of the bridge.\nPer Coast Guard regulations and the BNSF Fort Madison River Bridge operations manual, river traffic has the right-of-way over train and vehicle traffic on the bridge. Durations of openings vary depending on weather, river current, size and number of boats, and, occasionally, mechanical problems. A typical opening for a tow with 15 barges lasts 15\u201320 minutes. The bridge opens over 2,000 times per year, an average of more than five times per day.",

West was a New Englander who came west to become an early settler of the Monroe area. He had a diverse career, including lead miner, lumberman, state senator, and California explorer. During the Civil War he commanded the 31st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In the 1850s, West built a wooden octagon house on the same property as the current house, but it was torn down in the 1930s.West built the current octagon house from 1860 to 1861, with walls of brick two stories high. Most octagon houses are a single octagon, but this one is three joined polygons, with a rectangular wing behind and a small octagonal cupola on top of them all. The styling outside is Italianate, with brackets and knob pendants under the eaves.Inside, the first floor contains a foyer, a parlor, a study, and a dining room, with the rectangular wing containing a kitchen, a family room, and a patio. Some of these rooms have parquet floors. The second floor holds bedrooms and a bathroom, with a library in the rectangular wing. From the start, West's house included a progressive-for-the-time gravity plumbing system fed by a tank in the attic, and an \"air conditioning\" system which let air funnel from the cupola above into the rooms below.Orson Fowler of New York was the proponent of octagon houses, publishing a book on them in 1847.

        "long_description": "The George Jones Memorial Baptist Church, also known as the \"Wheat Church,\" is a historic church building at the former site of the community of Wheat in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States. It is the only structure remaining from Wheat, a rural Roane County community that was dissolved in 1942 when the United States government assumed ownership of the land for the Manhattan Project.\nFounded in 1854 as a United Baptist congregation by 26 members of the Sulphur Springs Church of Christ, it was established in Wheat in the northern part of Roane County.  Originally named the \"Mount Zion Baptist Church,\" it changed its name to \"George Jones Memorial Baptist Church\" in 1901, after a local minister who had donated most of the land for the community.  In the same year, the congregation built a new building, which remains today.The church is considered a good example of a rural vernacular church building.  It is a three-bay, rectangular plan brick building with wood cladding, a square bell tower, and a standing-seam metal roof.  There are two rooms in its interior, an anteroom and the sanctuary, separated from one another by a waist-high partition. A 1\u00bd acre cemetery is located west of the church.The George Jones church served not only as a religious facility, but also as a community gathering place for Wheat residents.  When Wheat was vacated by the federal government in 1942 as part of the Manhattan Project, the George Jones Memorial Baptist Church was abandoned with the rest of the community. All other Wheat buildings have been demolished. As the only pre-1942 building remaining in what was once Wheat, the church is the location of annual reunions of former residents.The church is east of the K-25 site and a short distance north of State Route 58, from which it is visible. It is located on the old Wheat Road, a gravel road (accessible from Blair Road (SR 327)) that follows the historical roadbed of a one-time local thoroughfare. The church building and the road are owned and maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy.  Motorized travel on the road is limited to government vehicles, but the road is open to pedestrians and bicycles as a public greenway trail.George Jones Memorial Baptist Church was one of six Oak Ridge properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. This listing reflects its significance as the only existing physical remnant of the Wheat community, a physical representation of rural life in the area in the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century, and an example of vernacular church architecture.\n\n",

        "long_description": "The George and John R. Hunt Memorial Building, often referred to as just the Hunt Memorial Building, is the former Ellenville, New York, United States, public library. It is located on Liberty Square, at the juncture of Liberty Place and Canal Street (NY 52), just across from the village's post office, another Registered Historic Place in Wawarsing.\nIt was built in 1917 as local headquarters for the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), with money from local benefactor John R. Hunt. His intention was that the building, designed by Frank Estabrook of Newburgh mostly in neoclassical style, would serve as both rented private office space to provide the building with income, and a public community center.Despite some decline in the condition of the building, it continued to serve as one of the three anchors of the village's downtown through the middle of the twentieth century, along with the post office and the since-burned Wayside Inn. To make ends meet, the WCTU had to rent out not only the office space but to go into the function hall business, using the public space. When the public library moved to its current quarters in 1975, the building was left without a major tenant, though over the next 15 years there was occupancy by The Ellenville News (a weekly community newspaper, for two years), TreSource and Fiber Industries (sustainable wood and forestry products), and the Plush Factory (stuffed toys); structural problems such as leaky roofs and badly built partitions accelerated its decay. Urban renewal efforts in Ellenville and the decline of the regional economy made the neighborhood less vibrant.The last major tenant, in the 1990s, was an appliance retailer. Howard Hellman, who had taken over ownership of the building, decided to donate it to the village in the hopes that it could find a buyer who could attract a mix of tenants and revitalize not only the building but downtown. These efforts proved as futile for the village as they had for Hellman.Local preservationists were interested in saving the building, however, and formed the Hunt Memorial Preservation Committee to raise funds and coordinate restoration efforts. The village has created a Historic Preservation Committee and taken other steps required by the state to coordinate rehabilitation efforts. Current plans call for a mix of public and private funds to be used to restore the masonry and repair the roof and windows. A stained glass skylight that had become severely deteriorated has been repaired, but is being kept in storage for safekeeping until the main room ceiling is fully renovated. In 2005 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as on the State of New York registry.  It is located in the Ellenville Downtown Historic District.\nThe ultimate intent is to restore the building to the point where it can serve its original purpose as a mixture of private and public space, providing a spur to the revival of downtown Ellenville. It remains in sporadic use, mostly as the venue for community events, such as the annual Run Like the Wind 10K race, the annual Blueberry/Huckleberry Festival, a summer series of concerts (Music in the Square), and art exhibits. After a local insurance agency vacated an office in the rear of the building, the space was renovated for use by the Ellenville/Wawarsing Chamber of Commerce, which completed its move of its office from its previous site on Berme Road in early 2008.\nIn 2015, Ulster County gave the village of Ellenville a million dollars for various local projects after it was passed over by the state as a casino site following a 2014 amendment to the state constitution that allowed casinos at several state locations. Of that money, $100,000 was allocated to restoring the Hunt Building. A little over one-third was used to shore up the main portico, while the rest went to refinishing the interior, although two rooms remain to be redone.The Hunt Memorial Building Commission, which the village set up to operate the building, installed a new roof and redid the flooring and the windows. It also found some intact furniture from the former Nevele resort just south of the village and put it in the building. Some of the utilities have been upgraded as well.In 2017, the village board announced it was seeking a $1.2 million state grant which, in conjunction with $150,000 already secured through state senator John Bonacic, will allow it to finish renovating the first floor. When completed, it will have a commercial-grade kitchen. The goal is for the space to be able to serve as a shelter for up to 30 residents during emergencies.\n\n",

Likely built by the Colchester Railway Company, the bridge was part of the 3.59 miles (5.78 km) of track from Colchester, Connecticut, to Turnerville (now known as Amston, Connecticut). The line was leased to the Boston and New York Air-Line Railroad and reported improvement in 1879 and a new 110-foot long (34 m) iron bridge by 1881. The line was leased to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1882. After dominating the region, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad petitioned for changes to the Air Line and the approval came on July 7, 1911.\nThe historic Blackledge River Railroad Bridge was constructed c. 1912 as an improved version of the previous bridge. The new 108-foot long (33 m) bridge integrated the previous abutments into the design and was elevated a further 5 feet (1.5 m) above the Blackledge River. The railroad bridge was abandoned in the 1960s and sold to the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 31, 1986. The bridge is now located in Airline State Park. By 2007, a wooden pedestrian bridge was built atop the railroad bridge and crosses over the Blackledge River.",

It was moved 35 years later to its present location, where it replaced the very first Bollman bridge. Today, it carries the Savage Mill Trail.\nThe Bollman design, a through truss bridge, was the first successful all-metal bridge design to be adopted and consistently used on a railroad. The type was named for its inventor, Wendel Bollman, a self-educated Baltimore civil engineer. Bollman formed two companies in Baltimore, the W. Bollman and Company and the Patapsco Bridge Company, to market the bridge in North and South America.\nIn 1966, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated the bridge as the first National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 18, 1972, and was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 16, 2000.",

Brabson's sons continued operating the plantation after his death, and established a business that catered to the ferry's traffic.  As the Brabsons supported the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War, their plantation was looted by Sevier County Unionists and toward the end of the war most members of the family were forced to flee.  Several eventually returned, however, and by the end of the 19th century had rebuilt the plantation and ferry.  The Brabson family still owns and manages the farm.",

Lewis Craig, leader of The Travelling Church, is the oldest constituted Baptist church in northeastern Kentucky and one of  six churches  included in  the  Bracken Association formed here in 1799. The congregation was constituted with ten members dismissed for that purpose from the Limestone/Washington Baptist Church in Mason County, KY (organized in 1785 by Elder William Wood), and presided over by Lewis Craig, who was still a member of the South Elkhorn Baptist Church in Fayette County, KY.Prior to construction of the 1840 structure, the congregation encountered several periods of discord.  In 1805, it split over the issue of slavery, with both congregations sharing  the  same log church. In 1829\u20131830, the rapid rise of Campbellism eventually led to worship in the Minerva Church on alternate Sundays by Campbellist and traditional factions.The church experienced a period of decline after 1850, and by 1886 only 60 members remained. The structure was used as a community center from 1900 to 1923 and baccalaureate services  for Minerva High School were held  there.  The  church structure was sold in 1928 for $280 and was used as a tobacco barn for the next forty years. The Bracken Association re-acquired the deteriorating structure in 1981.

        "long_description": "Branch Brook Park is a county park of Essex County, New Jersey. It is located in the North Ward of Newark, between the neighborhoods of Forest Hill and Roseville. A portion of the park is also located within the Township of Belleville.  At 360 acres (150 ha), Branch Brook Park is the largest public park in the city of Newark. The park is noted for the largest collection of cherry blossom trees in the United States, having over 5,000 in more than eighteen different varieties collectively called Cherryblossomland, as well as its spectacular Cherry Blossom Festival each April.The area had served as an Army training ground during the American Civil War. At the time, the northern portion of the area had been a marsh known as Old Blue Jay Swamp. In 1867, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the designers of Central Park, presented their report on the site to the Board of Commissioners of the Newark Park. It recommended Concourse Hill, with its commanding views of Newark and distant Manhattan, as the best location for the park.The park was formally created almost three decades later, in 1895, by the newly created Essex County Parks Commission, making it the nation's first county park. In 1898, a public appropriation financed the conversion of the swamp into a landscaped lake.  The initial park was only 60 acres (24 ha) in size but grew in the 1920s through private donations from prominent Newark families, such as the Ballantines, eventually reaching the city limit with Belleville and becoming one of the largest urban parks in the United States.  The Morris Canal originally ran on the park's west side, until its old bed was turned into the Newark City Subway, providing access to the park from Downtown Newark.\nThe first designs of the park, based largely on romantic garden themes, were proposed in 1895 and 1898, after the Parks Commission hired several architectural firms to plan the park. In 1900, the commission hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to redesign the park. The result was the park's current naturalistic look and feel, with acres of meadows and forests, in a manner similar to their father's earlier designs of Central Park and Prospect Park.\nThe park is home to many architecturally significant structures, including bridges, buildings, gates, and sculptures. Many of these were designed by the beaux-arts architectural firm of Carr\u00e8re and Hastings headed by John Merven Carr\u00e8re and Thomas Hastings. The pair designed two Subway Bridges now referred to as Subway 1, East and Subway 2, West.The famous cherry trees were the result of a 1927 gift from Caroline Bamberger Fuld, sister of department store magnate Louis Bamberger and widow of the store's vice president.  The Cherry Blossom Festival attracts approximately 10,000 visitors each April. Branch Brook Park also features a lake and a pond.\nDuring World War II, the park's grounds served a tent city for recruits, as well as a landing strip for airplanes of the United States Postal Service.\nThe neighborhood on the east side of the park, Forest Hill, is Newark's most affluent.   Also on the east side of the park is the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart Basilica, one of the largest cathedrals in the United States.\nIt has been placed on both the New Jersey (1980) and National (1981) Registers of Historic Places.\nIn 1999 Branch Brook Park began a $25 million ten-year restoration program.

        "long_description": "The Bremner Historic Mining District is a historic district in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve in Alaska. It is named after John Bremner, who in 1884-1885 was the first non-native person to live in the area and who prospected for gold along the Bremner River. Located just to the north of the Bremner River, it was the scene of an important placer gold discovery in 1902, and played a key role in the history of the Copper River Basin. Only a few miners struck it rich, but the resulting demand for materials and supplies helped establish regional transportation networks, encouraged supporting industries, and hastened the exploration and settlement of the entire region. While small-scale placer mining continued for over forty years, lode development was largely confined to the period between 1934 and 1941, the district's most significant era.The Bremner Historic Mining District embodies its period of twentieth-century mining, illustrating both its mining process and its evolutionary sequence. Unusually complete, it retains virtually all of its historic components, including an important placer site, a camp, four discrete lode mines, a mill, and an associated transportation network.The Golconda Mining Company site, which contains a campsite, an elaborate ditch, and extensive piles of hand-stacked cobble, provides an example of an early placer mining system. The Goldconda complex includes two airstrips dating to the 1930s.The Yellow Band mining camp is one of the region's most complete, not only containing the typical housing and office facilities, but a sophisticated hydroelectric system. This camp is also significant for its association with Asa C. Baldwin, a distinguished regional explorer, surveyor, and mining engineer. While working for the U.S. Geodetic Survey, Baldwin completed the first American marine survey of Kodiak and the Aleutian Islands in 1909. From 1910 to 1913, he served as a field officer with the U.S.-Canadian International Boundary Survey. Over the years, Baldwin worked locally as a consulting engineer, where, among other activities, he advised the Kennecott Copper Company and the Copper River and Northwestern Railway. Baldwin began prospecting in the Bremner District in the early 1930s, and from 1936 to 1940, was president of the Yellow Band Mining Company. He acquired the Bremner Gold Mining Company holdings in 1939.Lucky Girl, Grand Prize, Sheriff, and Yellow Band Mines are examples of remote underground mining operations. With each containing a variety of buildings and structures. While Lucky Girl mill is now ruinous due to repeated avalanche strikes, its operating machinery remains intact and in most cases in situ.In addition to Baldwin, the Bremner district is associated with aviator Merle \"Mudhole\" Smith, who started flying supplies for the Cordova Air Service in the 1930s, and who became stuck on the upper Golconda strip.  Smith operated Cordova Air Service until 1968, when it merged with Alaska Airlines.",

Today Luna is preserved in Boston Harbor, where her rehabilitation process has been underway since the tug was rescued from being broken up in 1995.

He platted small 25 feet (7.6 m)-wide lots, as opposed to the normal lot width of 40 feet (12 m), in an effort to attract people who wanted to build summer lake cottages.Loren L. Chadwick built these two cottages in 1902 at a cost of $300 each. They were small, measuring 16 feet (4.9 m) by 30 feet (9.1 m), and had screened porches to take advantage of summer breezes from the nearby lakes. The two cottages were rented out as summer homes for more than a decade before they were bought by individual owners. In 1972, a new owner joined the two cottages with an addition on the rear. The cottages were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. They are significant because although their design is simple, their survival demonstrates a good example of cottage architecture in Minneapolis. Despite their simplicity, the cottages have Carpenter Gothic detailing on the vergeboards of their gable and porch roofs.",

Senator Trumbull lived in this house from 1849 to 1863, according to the documentation provided in the National Historic Landmark application.\nThe house is a 1+1\u20442-story red brick, gable-roofed residence with limestone foundation.  It was originally rectangular-shaped, but late in the 19th century an addition was built on the rear of the house, transforming it into an L-shaped residence.  There are three gabled dormers protruding from the front roof, one on the rear of the original house, and one on the northern elevation of the roof on the addition.\nAdorning the front of the house is a centrally-located one-bay entrance porch supported by two fluted pilasters, all made of wood.  Turned balusters flank the porch and the several wooden steps that lead to a brick walkway surrounding the dwelling.  An entrance to the basement is located underneath the porch.  The chief front entrance to the Trumbull House is a single door with side lights and semi-elliptical fanlight.

The conversion of one of these houses into Locke's Tavern in 1825 brought some additional growth along Main Street, resulting in the construction of several Greek Revival houses.  The most significant growth in the area came in the second half of the 19th century, when a number of Queen Anne, Shingle style, and Colonial Revival houses were built.  Most of these buildings were large, and are now either multifamily residences of housing for the schools.  Two of the buildings on Locke Street were built for fraternal organizations, one of which, the November Club at 6 Locke Street, is believed to be the oldest women's club building in New England.Despite the variety of architectural styles represented, the district has some uniformity in the proportion and setback of the houses, especially on Main Street.

The park was established in 1936 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\nMore than 700,000 people visit the battlefield each year. The Henry Hill Visitor Center, on Sudley Road by the south entrance to the park, offers exhibits and interpretation regarding the First Battle of Bull Run, including Civil War-era uniforms, weapons, field gear and an electronic battle map. The center offers the orientation film Manassas: End of Innocence, as well as a bookstore.\nA recent find in 2014 unearthed bone fragments that led to the discovery of the skeletal remains of two Union soldiers in what is now thought to be a Surgeon's Pit. The remains were found among the bones of several other limbs in the pit. Carbon dating shows that the pair died during the Battle of Second Manassas, also known as Second Bull Run, in August 1862. The remains were moved on Tuesday, June 19, 2018, and transferred from the National Park Service to the US Army who will be burying them in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n",

It is currently operated as a performing arts center.\nOne of the few remaining links to Pocomoke's past is the Mar-Va Theater. Its name is representative of its location, since the theater is located in Maryland, only a short distance from the Virginia state line. With originally 720 seats, the Mar-Va is the largest theater south of Wilmington, Delaware, which has never been altered. Once used as a vaudeville theater complete with stage facilities, dressing rooms and orchestra pits, the Mar-Va was played by many performers, which included some old-time cowboys such as Tom Mix, Roy Rogers, William Boyd and Smiley Burnette.\nMr. & Mrs. Frank Barlett of Berlin, Maryland built the Mar-Va Theater in 1927. It has been estimated that it would probably cost around $250,000 to build by present economic standards.The Mar-Va Theater is one of the few theaters on the shore to boast of a draw drape. The sidewalls have the original gold embossed paneling and the projectors, which were added around 1943, are of the carbon arc variety. The balcony was once used for segregation purposes. It had its own entrance, concession area, box office and bathroom. The seats in the balcony were considered the best in the theater.\nThe theater opened on December 1, 1927 with John & Lester Fox managing the theater while J. Dawson Clarke played the piano for the old silent movies. In 1949, after the death of John Fox, J. Dawson Clarke and Orville Mason bought the theater and, in 1967, the ownership went to Dawson and his wife Hattie.\nWhen the theater originally opened, ticket prices were 10 cents. At the time of its closing in 1993, a ticket cost $3.50. Soda pop, sold in the soda parlor next door, once cost 10 cents and popcorn was always sold for 10 cents a bag.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.",

However, the property was not maintained and fell into disrepair. In 2012, several of Carll's heirs filed a lawsuit to have the farm returned to them due to the lack of maintenance and state of disrepair of the property. However, this lawsuit was dismissed in 2017.In 2019, the Commack School District announced that they would be leasing part of the farm to Long Island University for a veterinary school and that it would be using the funding from the lease to restore the farm. Despite this announcement, some local activists remain unconvinced that enough funding will be raised to be able to accomplish a proper restoration. Long Island University signed a 10-year lease and intends to raise grazing animals on 6 acres of the property for students to practice clinical skills on.",

Owned by the Gooding family for 175 years, this farmstead and tavern played an important role in the commercial development of Orange Township and Delaware County during the 19th century and early 20th century.  The property demonstrates the broad pattern of Ohio's transportation-related commerce in the early 19th century, when inns and taverns were built to accommodate and sustain the traveler.\nThe Gooding House provides an example of the architectural evolution of a property from Ohio's settlement period, through the more prosperous years of the mid-19th century, to the changes brought by the early 20th century.  The building exhibits significant architectural features from each of these three periods:  1820s Federal influences, 1850s early Italianate influences, and 1910s Colonial Revival and Craftsman influences.

        "long_description": "The Governor John Langdon House, also known as Governor John Langdon Mansion, is a historic mansion house at 143 Pleasant Street in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States.   It was built in 1784 by Founding Father John Langdon (1741-1819), a merchant, shipbuilder, American Revolutionary War general, signer of the United States Constitution, and three-term President (now termed governor) of New Hampshire.  The house he built for his family showed his status as Portsmouth's leading citizen and received praise from George Washington, who visited there in 1789. Its reception rooms are ornamented by elaborate wood carving in the rococo style.  The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974, and is now a house museum operated by Historic New England.\nThe house Langdon had built resembles typical late Georgian houses, with five bays across, a center entry, and four rooms on each floor, flanking a grand central hall and stairway.  It is built on a larger and grander scale than most houses, and has very high quality interior woodwork.  The interior joinery is attributed to Ebenezer Clifford, a leading woodworker of the Portsmouth area.  The main entry is also particularly elaborate with a large door flanked by pairs of engaged columns, and sheltered by a semi-circular portico supported by Corinthian columns and topped by a balustrade.After Langdon's death in 1819, his lone surviving daughter continued to use the house, but did not live there.  Between 1833 and 1902 the house passed through several hands.  In the 1850s a fire severely damaged the southwest corner of the house, which was reconstructed.  In 1877 the house came into the hands of Frances E. Bassett, a descendant of John Langdon's brother Woodbury.  Her son and daughter-in-law, Woodbury and Elizabeth Langdon, converted the house into a Colonial Revival showplace, adding a two-story wing designed by McKim, Mead & White whose details harmonize well with the original structure, and include a dining room based on one built by the ancestral Woodbury Langdon and preserved in the Rockingham Hotel.  Elizabeth Langdon deeded the property to Historic New England in 1947.The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974.  It is open to the public for tours on weekends from June to October, and the grounds are available for functions.",

The four-story building was built in 1871 by the Delaware Grand Lodge of Masons to serve as a Masonic Temple and auditorium. The construction cost was $100,000.  It was designed in Second Empire style by Baltimore architect Thomas Dixon and incorporates symbolism from Freemasonry into the cast-iron facade.  Its central pediment contains an Eye of Providence.\nHistorically, the Grand hosted a variety of operas, symphonies, Victorian melodramas, minstrel shows, burlesque, vaudeville, and other exhibitions, including performers such as Ethel Barrymore, \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody and \"Texas Jack\" Omohundro, and John Philip Sousa. For most of the twentieth century the Grand was operated exclusively as a movie theater, run by Warner Brothers from 1930 and eventually closing in 1967.  It was reopened four years later and returned to programming emphasizing classical music, partnering with the Delaware Symphony Orchestra, OperaDelaware, and the First State Ballet Theatre.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 with assertions of both architectural and historical significance.  It was argued it is \"one of the finest remaining examples of 19th century cast iron architecture in America\" and that it has important association with events and persons in Delaware's history.In 1973, management was turned over to a non-profit organization and the building underwent extensive restoration, which was completed in 1976.",

The theater changed hands many times in the 20th century, and at various times was known as the Paramount Theatre and The Wheaton Theatre. In the late 1990s, the theater was used for second-run films, and more recently, as a small concert hall for rock and roll bands. The theater was donated to the non-profit Grand Theater Corporation in October 2001. In the fall of 2005, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was closed in 2006 for a full renovation of the property and the Grand Theater Corporation was anticipating to re-open it as a single screen theater in late 2011. However, Wheaton rejected a plan to allocate $19.3 million to finance the renovation and the theater's debts. Wheaton Park District is currently considering a $10 million plan that would reopen the theater with 860 seats. The theater will feature a donated Morton organ from the 1920s, originally from one of the Loew's Wonder Theatres.",

The district is bounded by Park Place, Alabama Avenue, M Street, and Lake Avenue.One of the city's oldest neighborhoods still intact, Grandview Heights was built as an extension of Palm Beach Heights from around 1910 to 1925. The neighborhood has one of the city's best collection of early craftsman-style bungalows, as well as some modest, Mediterranean revival-style homes. Grandview Heights first residents were ministers, downtown shopkeepers, and the craftsmen who built the luxury hotels of Palm Beach. Despite having modest elevation, it contained the highest elevation to the south to Cuba, and at the time provided views of Lake Worth Lagoon over Woodlawn Cemetery and Pioneer Memorial Park.\nAfter a period of urban decline in the 1980s, almost all of Palm Beach Heights and portions of Grandview Heights were demolished in 1989 to make way for the proposed Downtown/Uptown urban revitalization project. This land, immediately north of the neighborhood, later became CityPlace, a New Urbanist mixed-use shopping and dining district.\nGrandview Heights neighborhood has been restored to a mixed-use, walkable neighborhood with a mix of mostly single family homes, modern townhomes, and apartments. Also located in the neighborhood are two historic churches, several bed and breakfasts, and small local businesses.\nThe west end of the neighborhood is Howard Park, the largest urban park in West Palm Beach. Howard Park contains the historic Stub Canal Turning Basin, originally used for unloading crops grown to the west, including the central portions of the state near Lake Okeechobee, for shipment to the North. At the time, the land just across the canal from the park remained undeveloped marshlands, and was used for hunting. During the land-boom era, Howard Park was used as camp for settlers, including tent-sites, running water, and out-houses provided by the city. This camp was later converted to a Boy Scout camp, and is the location of the present-day dog park. Some tourists and settlers would alternatively rent apartments located over garages in the neighborhood, providing additional income to residents. The historic Art Deco style Armory building was built in 1939 with WPA funds for use by the National Guard. It currently houses the Armory Arts Center, which includes an art school and galleries.\nImmediately east of the neighborhood is the historic Woodlawn Cemetery, the South Dixie shopping district, and the Norton Museum of Art.",

In turn, the Hicksites split in 1843 over the issue of slavery; the liberal party kept the original church, while the conservatives moved to South Charleston-Clifton Road and built the present building.Built of brick, the Green Plain Monthly Meetinghouse is a Greek Revival building; in line with the simple habits of its builders, the meetinghouse features few adornments.  It has been virtually unchanged since its construction, still retaining original elements such as the structural separation between the men's side and the women's side of the interior.In 1982, the meetinghouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The church was built by German immigrants, who were among the earliest settlers in Isanti County, Minnesota. German settlers in the southeastern portion of Bradford Township wanted their own church with services in their native language.  Church services were held in members' homes until the church was formally organized in 1882 and a building was built on donated land.The building is one story high, built in the Greek Revival style, with white clapboard siding on the exterior.  The interior was heated with a simple wood stove at the back of the church, and lit with kerosene lamps and Coleman Quick-Lite chandeliers.  It also did not have running water or inside bathrooms.  The chancel and pulpit were donated by a church in Osseo, Minnesota, that was doing its own renovations.  The community never had a congregation large enough to justify having a full-time pastor.  The church relied on lay people to do readings, as well as sharing a pastor with St. John's of Weber, Minnesota.  Pastor F.J. Mack, who served from 1924 through 1945, began offering services in English and stopped offering services in German.  In 1959, the congregation decided to merge with St. John's of Weber after facing declining membership.In 1976, a restoration project saved the church from destruction, and around this time, the church and its grounds were deeded to the Isanti County Historical Society.  The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, but the building again fell into disrepair \u2013 until 2004, when a group, The Friends of Historic St. John's, Inc., [now a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization] was formed to support the renovation.  With the help of over 300 financial contributors and hard working volunteers, major restoration was completed.  The building and grounds are now used for traditional German cultural programs, weddings, christenings, and memorial services.",

It is now the Monticello Heritage and Cultural Center.  It is the only church in Iowa designed by nationally prominent architects Cram & Ferguson, who specialized in ecclesiastical architecture.\nThe church congregation sought high design quality and, as recorded in the NRHP nomination for the church, the local newspaper reported in 1949 thatIt was felt that the church building could never be better than its design so an effort was made to secure the ablest architects available and the world famous firm of Cram & Ferguson of Boston were selected. This firm was the designers of the Great Episcopal Cathedrals in New York (Cathedral of St. John the Divine) and Detroit (Cathedral Church of St. Paul), St. Thomas Church and Christ Methodist in New York, Calgary Church in Pittsburgh, the House of Hope Presbyterian Church in St. Paul, the famous Fourth Presbyterian Church in Chicago and hundreds of other churches throughout the eastern part of the nation. This is, however, their first church in Iowa. (Monticello Express 1949 \"Drawing of the New Methodist Church\"):\u200a19\u200a\nHow the building committee of St. Luke's Church got connected to the Boston architectural firm is not known, but may have been through Rev. Dr. Daniel L. Marsh (1880-1968).  Marsh, president of Methodist-affiliated Boston University, obtained Cram & Ferguson to design Marsh Chapel and many other campus buildings which were widely covered in Methodist publications.The congregation was founded in 1858 and built its first church, on this site, in 1863, at cost of $1,750.00.  The original was replaced in 1899 by a second that suffered design problems.  The 1949-1950 church is the third Methodist church.  After its completion the congregation had 350 members, but eventually declined and in the 1990s joined up with the local Congregational church to form the United Church of Monticello.  The combined church alternated worship services in the two churches for a time.  The St. Luke's church was eventually provided to the Monticello Heritage and Cultural Center, a group interested in its preservation, which obtained a grant from the Historic Site Preservation Grant Program of the State\nHistorical Society of Iowa in 2000, enabling it to purchase the property. In 2001, the building was being used as a performance venue, for cultural programs, and as a history museum.:\u200a8,\u200a17\u200aThere was a design challenge in the small church's requirement for a large community room, as a steeply pitched roof consistent with Late Gothic Revival styling could have required a very high roofline, higher than on the main church area.  This was solved by designing a somewhat complex roof system that had ups and downs.  Gothic Revival styling is also apparent in building materials choices and in many architectural details.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.  It was deemed significant as an illustration of how the Cram & Ferguson architects adapted Late Gothic Revival styling to the design of a small church.",

The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The bridge no longer carries traffic, which has since been shifted to another bridge to the east.The bridge was designed by James Barney Marsh and built in 1911, the same year in which he filed a patent for his rainbow arch design. His design features two arched ribs, one on either side of the roadway, rising above the deck. The deck is suspended from the arches by vertical risers. Drivers see the rainbow arch crowns on each side, similar to crossing a pony truss bridge. The bridge over the Little Cottonwood River is one of the oldest Marsh rainbow arches in the country. Unfortunately, as traffic flow increased and farm machinery got larger, many of Marsh's rainbow arch designs became obsolete, since they could not be widened. There are only half a dozen Marsh rainbow arch bridges remaining in Minnesota.",

Housed in a complex of historic buildings along the former Lincoln Highway, the school and an associated children's home were founded to serve impoverished children throughout northwestern Ohio.Born in 1833, George H. Marsh settled in Van Wert at the age of twelve with his father.  Growing to adulthood, he erected the present farmhouse in the first half of the 1860s; a two-story brick structure, it is a built in the plan of a cross.  As the years passed, Marsh became very wealthy, and he became determined to use his wealth to help others.  According to locals, Marsh and his family were returning home from Fort Wayne, Indiana on a winter night and saw two impoverished children, and consequently his wife Hilinda suggested dedicating their estate to children such as those two.\nAfter Marsh's death, his will provided more than $5,000,000 for the establishment of a foundation to administer the school.  In 1923, the trustees contracted with Langdon, Hohly, and Gram, a Toledo architectural company, to build six school buildings on the Marsh farm.  Since that time, the school and home have served the community of Van Wert, while the original house has been converted into a museum.In 1980, the Marsh homestead and school buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places; twenty-one buildings across the complex qualified as contributing properties.  The property qualified for inclusion on the Register both because of its distinctive architecture and because of its connection to Marsh: he was one of Van Wert's leading citizens, and the school buildings are among the best Jacobethan structures in western Ohio.\n\n",

The 1901 building was the fourth for the department store at this site.Marshall Field's established numerous important business \"firsts\" in this building and in the series of previous elaborate decorative structures on this site for the last century and a half, and it is regarded as one of the three most influential establishments in the nationwide development of the department store and in the commercial business economic history of the United States.  The name of the stores formerly headquartered at this building changed on September 9, 2006, as a result of the merger that produced Macy's, Inc. and led to the integration of the Marshall Field's stores into the Macy's now nationwide retailing network.The building, which is the third largest store in the world, was both declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 2, 1978,  and it was designated a Chicago Landmark on November 1, 2005.

Talley and built in 1910 at the corner of West Main Street (now Old Main Street) and South Pine Avenue in Inverness, Citrus County, Florida. It is also known as Inverness Masonic Temple. As was common with American Masonic buildings of the time, the first floor was used for retail stores, while the second floor was used for professional offices and the third floor was used for the lodge hall and other Masonic uses. Over the years, the second floor also housed the city hall and a movie theater. After repairing the fire damage from a lightning strike in 1963, Citrus Lodge decided to build a new building at 301 Hendrix Avenue and vacated the premises in 1965. The building was then sold to a series of private owners. In 1990 the Board of County Commissioners rented the third floor for a few years. Recent uses include the building management office on the ground floor, bookkeepers, attorneys, insurance agents, therapists, tutor services and an AA Intergroup office on the other floors.\nIn 1989, the Masonic Temple was listed in A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture, published by the University of Florida Press. On October 20, 2000, the City of Inverness placed a commemorative plaque on the building. The building was purchased by the Drywell Group, LLC in 2006 and they proceeded to renovate and restore the interior and exterior. Wood floors and windows were refinished, period furniture, lighting, art, and paint colors were added throughout the building. The exterior brick was re-pointed or painted, windows were repaired and painted, and the metal cornice and Masonic sign were restored. A \u201chistory walk\u201d of the building graces the first floor hall and a small exhibit about the building renovation/rehabilitation is on the second floor. During the rehabilitation, an application was submitted to the State of Florida for recognition of the Masonic Temple's historic status and on June 23, 2010, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n Today, the building is known as the \"Masonic Business Center,\" and the first floor continues to be used for retail shops, among them a Subway submarine sandwich shop.",

Although there are older houses along the street, the oldest in this district is the Second Empire house built c. 1867 at 30 May Street, after lot lines had been drawn on maps of the period.  The only other Second Empire house, at 33 May Street, was built c. 1873 and significantly restyled c. 1891 with Queen Anne details.  The other early buildings were Victorian Gothic houses at 32 and 34 May Street, built in the late 1870s, and a third at number 29, built c. 1880. Most of the remaining buildings were built between 1888 and 1896, with Queen Anne styling.  The notable exceptions are a triple decker at 49 May Street, and Victorian cottages at 31 and 56 May Street, built c. 1882 and c. 1886 respectively.\nThe neighborhood was during this period of development catering to businessmen and the owners of small manufacturing operations.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.The first settler in the area around St. Peter's arrived in 1848, from Bavaria. In subsequent years, more immigrants arrived from Cologne and Alsace-Lorraine. Many of these people were German Catholics, and they established a local parish, constructing their first church building in 1861. In 1867 they added a Catholic school.By 1901 the parish needed a new church building. Anton Dohman of Milwaukee designed the current building and J.H. Owens of Mazomanie contracted the masonry work. The walls are built of coursed limestone quarried from local farms. The front doors are at the base of a tall centered steeple. Above the door is a rose window, then three lancet windows, then a louvered belfry, then an octagonal spire, then a cross. Small apses project from the sides and a large apse from the back. Limestone buttresses divide the wall surfaces. The main roof is still covered by its original slate shingles.Inside, the nave contains two rows of oak pews, leading to the pinnacled altar in the apse on the south end. In the spandrels above the altar is a mural depicting Christ and his disciples. To the sides are a carved wood pulpit and lecterns. One side apse contains a baptistery and the other a grotto.The complex includes a two-story brick school/convent and a Queen Anne-styled rectory built in 1906, but neither building is included in the NRHP nomination.St. Peter's school, built in 1867, was the only school in Ashton until a public school opened in 1920. Today the church building remains the prominent building in the small community, and the steeple is visible for miles over the surrounding farmlands.",

It was built by St. Matthias parish of the Episcopal Church, now in the Diocese of Milwaukee, and is the oldest church building in Waukesha that survives basically intact.The Waukesha congregation began in 1839 or 1840 when Rev. Lemuel B. Hull of St. Paul's in Milwaukee walked out into the wilds to conduct the first Episcopal services there. In 1843 those early Episcopalians built a little chapel on Barstow Street. In 1844 the parish was formally organized with the Rev. James Lloyd Breck as the first rector.  Breck was invited to choose the patron saint of the church. In 1848 Rev. James Abercrombie became rector.In 1851 the parish began constructing the large limestone-clad building that still stands today. The cornerstone was laid that year with initial pledges of $1,000, but that proved insufficient, and Rev. Abercrombie had to go back east for $4,000 more for the building. The building's style is Gothic Revival, with its emphasis on the vertical clear in the spire and the pointed arches topping the windows and doorways. The walls are of local limestone, dressed, and randomly coursed. The main entrance is through the corner tower. The tower is square, with the lower parts flanked by diagonal buttresses, and the top capped with a spire that rises to a cross.A side-chapel was added to the building in 1887, built by Eales and Dresden.On October 28, 1983, the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an exemplar of Gothic Revival style in Waukesha and for its fine stonework.",

Under the leadership of Vicar-General Joseph Ferneding, the members bought the present site and surrounding properties in February 1848; their design was finalized four months later, and construction was financed by the sale of the land now comprising the surrounding neighborhood.  Construction was finished in 1850; the completed building measures 150 by 68 feet (46 m \u00d7 21 m) and stands 48 feet (15 m) tall with a tin-covered gabled roof; the building is built of brick on a stone foundation.  A fire in 1899 destroyed all but the church walls and German-made stained glass windows, but reconstruction began at once, and the new St. Paul's was dedicated on October 7, 1900. Light fills the interior and the proscenium is supported by twelve Corinthian columns.  This brick Romanesque structure has broad Doric pilasters set in its corners and between its tall, round arched windows. It has a Renaissance tower capped with a Pope's Mitre cupola roof and gilded cross. The three arched doorways face Spring Street.Deconsecrated in 1974, the church complex was named to the National Register of Historic Places in the same year; the buildings compose a historic district, the \"St. Paul Church Historic District\". In 1981, The Verdin Company, a bell and clock company, purchased the church, convent, schools, and rectory. The buildings were restored and the church was transformed into a bell and clock museum/showroom. The other buildings were transformed into art galleries.  The records for this parish are located at Old St. Mary's Church.\nIn 1983, the Ohio Historical Society gave the Verdin Company an award for its use of the church building, praising their restoration and adaptive reuse of the church.Today, the church is owned by Cafeo Hospitality. It is now a venue for weddings and corporate events.",

The bell was a gift from the Sunday school children at St. Peter's Church in Philadelphia. It arrived in October 1874, but the church in Tacoma had no belfry. Loggers cut off the top of a tree growing next to the church and a crew of sailors used the ship's rigging to hoist it up on the stump. The rings of the tree were counted when the tree was cut, revealing that it was over 300 years old. The tree claimed fame as \"the oldest bell tower in America\". The original tree stump was damaged by a windstorm in 1935 and had to be replaced.",

It presently consists of 12 buildings, 10 of which were built before 1931.\nThe camp was originally designed by Reid's niece, Ella Spencer Reid, who also named the camp. It was begun on land that was leased; Mildred Phelps Stokes Hooker (1881\u20131970), daughter of Anson Phelps Stokes, in her Camp Chronicles, sniffs that \"she seems to have built before she owned.\" The land was purchased by the Reids in 1890. The main lodge of unpeeled cedar logs, called the Living Room, was designed by McKim, Mead and White, and is the only known example of a rustic design from that firm. It was added in 1917 after a fire damaged earlier structures; it features sitting and billiard rooms overlooking the lake.  The \"Bishop's Palace\", a small log octagon set at the water's edge with a massive fireplace and chimney, was named for its occasional use by Episcopalian clerics; there are two other, similar buildings at the camp, all designed by William Rutherford Mead.  There is also a guest cottage with eight bedrooms, two boathouses and a recreation hall.  The main buildings are connected by stone walkways.

Elliott and constructed by Prescott, Arizona contractor Joe Petit for $9,000 to $10,000 on land donated by the town's founder, Joe Mayer. Since its completion in 1915, it was continuously used as a school, except for 1982\u20131987, until 2002 when it was condemned by the fire marshal. It became a fully accredited high school in the 1930s with the installation of indoor plumbing. It was not used as a high school after 1981. Elementary students continued to attend from 1988 to 2002. When constructed, the building faced the town's main street (called Main Street) but the street was later moved to the rear of the building. It also faced the tracks of the Prescott and Eastern Railroad until they were removed in 1949.

The park is a non-profit organization in partnership with the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government Division of Parks and Recreation. The mission statement of this organization is to restore and preserve McConnell Springs as a national historic site, an educational resource for culture and environment, and a passive recreational park.McConnell Springs Park is an ecosystem of karst topography. This type of landscape is the result of water dissolving soluble rock, such as limestone, thus creating sinkholes, underground streams, caves, and springs. The most significant environmental feature is a complex system of sinking springs. McConnell Springs is the only known site in Fayette County that has a series of artesian springs that come to the surface, go underground, reappear, flow on the surface and go back underground only to surface again a third of a mile away. About 20% of the United States is underlain with karst landscapes, and 40% of all drinking water comes from karst aquifers.McConnell Springs has two major natural springs. The first is The Blue Hole, which gets its name due to appearance of the water looking blue. The illusion of the colored water is due to the 15 foot depth of this spring. The second major spring is The Boils. Although some may think that this spring is hot due to its given name, it is not. It gets its name due to the heavy rain water that rushes up from underground which in return makes the spring appear as it is boiling. The last feature is named The Final Sink. All the water from the park flows into this sink hole which then resurfaces at Preston's Cave Spring.\nMcConnell Springs is historically and environmentally significant to this area. The naming of Lexington is the central historic event which marked McConnell Springs' place in history. William McConnell and his party of kinsmen, companion surveyors, explorers and would-be settlers established a small camp in this area in June 1775. The group named their camp \"Lexington\" in honor of one of the first battles of the American Revolutionary War in Lexington, Massachusetts. Four years later this name was adopted when founding their town. In the ensuing years, the McConnell property changed hands several times with remnants of past use still visible throughout the park - including stone fences, a barn foundation, a small rock quarry, remains of an old dam and the foundation of an old creamery. The site became an unused, dilapidated area, used mainly for industrial dumping space. In the early 1990s, the community of Lexington decided to restore McConnell Springs as a historic site and nature education center, leading to the formation on the Friends of McConnell Springs Organization. Debris was removed from the site, and the land was placed into the city park system to be preserved. The Kentucky American Water Nature Center was constructed, and the park was opened to the public in 1994.McConnell Springs also has two miles of trails, with a half-mile paved loop which makes the park accessible to most visitors, as well as an education center.\nMcConnell Springs park is protected sanctuary by the city of Lexington. It has rules such as no pets and no camping. The water surface quality is also regularly monitored to ensure that the springs are natural and not being contaminated by pollutants.",

The asylum was established in 1892 as the state's first facility for dealing with chronic mental patients.  The college-like campus was designed by William Pitt Wentworth and developed between 1896 and 1914. After an era dominated by asylums built using the Kirkbride Plan, Medfield Insane Asylum was the first asylum built using the new Cottage Plan layout, where instead of holding patients in cells, they would be integrated into a small community and work a specific job.  It was formally renamed \"Medfield State Hospital\" in 1914.At its height the complex included 58 buildings, on a property of some 1.4 sq mi (3.6 km2), and a capacity of 2,200 patients. It raised its own livestock and produce, and generated its own heat, light and power. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, the property was closed in April 2003 and the buildings shuttered.  The grounds have been restored, and reopened to the public and are open every day from sun up to sundown. It has been used as a filming location for thriller/horror motion pictures such as The New Mutants, Shutter Island, and The Box. As of July 2012, The Clark Building was demolished. Local Medfield Police now patrol the facility. Trespassing is strictly forbidden past dark and until sunrise. Within the grounds of the hospital lies the Medfield State Hospital Cemetery which has 841 gravesites. This cemetery was opened from 1918 until 1988. Originally, only numbers were on the graves in this cemetery until a Boy Scout from Troop 89 made it his Eagle Scout service project to find the names and dates of death of all those buried in the cemetery.\nStarting in October 2013 demolition of three buildings was completed; The Odyssey House, the Carriage House, and the Laundry Building.",

In 1968, Jane and Leonard Carleton sold 10 1/4 acres to the Meigs County Agricultural Society. This land would become part of the Rocksprings Fairgrounds. Jane Carleton deeded 98 additional rods of land to the Meigs County Agricultural Society on Christmas Eve of 1899.  The construction dates of some elements of the grounds are unknown, but the present sharply-curved racetrack was finished in 1889 or earlier, when it was converted from a one-third mile track into a half mile track.  In 1890, donations by average citizens paid for the construction of a grandstand by the track to supplement a nearby hillside where fairgoers had previously sat.  Instead of being placed simply along one side of the track, the grandstand curves around the northeastern turn of the track; it is the only curved grandstand at an Ohio county fairgrounds. The grandstand is capable of holding one thousand people.In 1946, a Junior Fair Board was established, and it is made up of kids from groups that make up the Junior Fair. The Junior Fair Board is still in effect to this day.In 1982, much of the fairgrounds, including the racetrack and grandstand, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Besides the unusual method of construction seen in the grandstand and track, the fairgrounds qualified for its importance in the area's social history as a reflection of the importance of fairgoing, especially harness racing at the track, to Meigs County residents.",

The building was fireproof, as no combustible materials were used during construction, either internally or externally. The entire cost of the structure was $150,000.\nThe Metropolitan Savings Bank was chartered in New York in 1852. In 1935 the bank moved its headquarters from Cooper Square to 754 Broadway. In 1942, it merged with the Manhattan Savings Institution (founded 1852) and the Citizens Savings Bank to form the Manhattan Savings Bank.

The front of the house is a simple square, but its facade is broken up by the roofline of the porch, which includes a gazebo with a dome and cast iron decorations.  These elements are newer than the rest of the house, having been added in the 1890s at the same time as a relocation, at which time the house was turned to face Greendale Avenue.  When built, the house was a simple box in the Greek Revival style, and it assumed its present Second Empire appearance only after an intermediate period in which the style was a generic Victorian.  The previous occupant of the site had been a summer cottage.The Resor House was built for William Resor, a wealthy businessman who had become prominent in Cincinnati society through the prosperity of his stove factory.  In his old age, Resor participated in such civic activities as the establishment of the Cincinnati Zoo and the creation of the Cincinnati Art Museum.In 1973, the Resor House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, due to its well-preserved historic architecture.  Five years later, it was one of many properties in the Clifton neighborhood designated a historic district, the Clifton Avenue Historic District, and added together to the Register.",

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an archeological site, it is maintained by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).\nA round bubble in appearance, it pops up from a flat wide bed of ancient basalt lava. An inflationary or uplift cave is inside the bubble. While archeologists are uncertain of exact dates prior to 10,000 years ago, evidence has been found that native peoples lived at Wilson Butte Cave at least 10,000 years ago. Artifacts found here provide the oldest evidence of human presence on the Snake River Plain and are among the oldest such evidence in all of North America. Archeologists are fairly certain that the reason the cave was settled so early is that it was used as a base from which to hunt bison. Strong connections have been found to the Fremont culture and the Shoshone people, who lived there after the Fremont peoples. Vegetation in the region was very similar to modern times. Camels and giant ground sloths once roamed this region. Deposits here are believed to have been undisturbed until amateurs discovered them in 1958. Two of the major excavations of the cave were conducted by teams led by Ruth Gruhn; one in 1959\u20131960 and one in 1988\u20131989. Gruhn dates the site's earliest occupation to 14,000\u201315,000 years ago.\nThe lava of the area is a dark gray to black fine-grained basalt. The cave is a lava tube developed in a pressure ridge in the flowing lava. The source of the lava is Wilson's Butte, which is about one half mile southeast of the cave. The lava is more than 15,000 years old, as determined by radiocarbon dating of a camel bone from within a lava tube cave. The bone had tool markings indicating working by humans.",

The resulting plowing brought up enough artifacts to warrant further investigation of the site, and in 1954, archaeologists conducted a test excavation.  Among the artifacts discovered during this process were pottery, bones, and stone chips.Archaeologists believe that the Winegardner Village was once occupied by a Middle or Late Woodland people.  It is one of several Woodland period villages in the area, and its position atop a bluff overlooking Little Rush Creek gives it a defensive advantage that has often been cited in archaeological analysis of the site.  Artifacts such as broken pottery and fire-burned stones have been seen as evidence that the site was occupied by a dense population.:\u200a67\u200aIn recognition of the site's archaeological significance, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

Constructed for a self-made grocery magnate, the Tudor Revival mansion has been named a historic site.\nBorn in 1860 in the Cincinnati-area community of Cherry Grove, Stephen Gerrard supported himself in his youth as a street peddler, but ultimately made himself wealthy by taking advantage of refrigerated rail cars to transport cantaloupes nationwide, selling them far more widely than was otherwise possible.  His sales of Colorado melons throughout the country's central and eastern regions enriched Gerrard, gaining him the nickname of \"Cantaloupe King\", and enabling him to build the present house in 1915 as well as constructing a grand mausoleum in the same section of Spring Grove Cemetery as other prominent local businessmen.  Its location in North Avondale, a gaslight neighborhood, made Gerrard a neighbor to some of Cincinnati's economic \u00e9lites.  However, his fortune was destroyed by the Great Depression, and he died in 1936.Built of limestone with a limestone foundation, the Tudor Revival house is covered with a slate roof.  Two and a half stories tall, the house features an irregular plan, with battlement-topped bay windows in assorted gables, tall chimneys, and a porte-coch\u00e8re sheltering the main entrance.  The windows are sheltered by hoodmolds, and the upper and lower sections of the facade are separated by a stone belt course.  Decorative elements in the upper part of the house include a pair of gargoyles atop the roof and the ornamental chimney pots atop the chimneys.  Extensive wooden panelling beautifies the interiors, which feature ornamental ceilings and marble fireplaces.  Upon its completion, the house possessed its own pipe organ, made by W.W. Kimball of Chicago.  The entire house has an area of 5,400 square feet (500 m2).In late 1987, the Gerrard mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture.

The overlook was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 for having state-level significance in politics/government and landscape architecture.  It was nominated as a leading example of the early wayside rests developed by the Minnesota Department of Highways Roadside Development Division, as well as for its sophisticated and well-preserved National Park Service rustic architecture, and for being an important work of Minnesota landscape architect Arthur R. Nichols.The main structure on the site is a limestone wall that overlooks the St. Croix River valley.  It was built by the National Youth Administration (NYA) between 1936 and 1937.  The limestone was salvaged from the old Minnesota Territorial Prison, which was demolished by the NYA beginning in 1936.  The construction is an excellent example of the National Park Service Rustic style, which emphasized the use of locally indigenous materials.  The labor-intensive construction techniques also reflect the need to employ many people in federal relief projects. The overlook is very well preserved.This overlook was one of several roadside development projects in the Stillwater area designed by Minnesota Highway Department landscape architect Arthur R. Nichols and built under Depression-era relief programs.  Other projects in this time included an overlook north of Stillwater, a roadside parking area at the St. Croix Boom Site, and an Indian battleground historic marker.  The roadside development in the Stillwater area reflected its importance as a tourist destination.",

Intending the building as a summer home, Stokes began building the castle in 1896, completing it in 1897.The castle is patterned after a tower that Stokes had seen and admired in the Roman Campagna in Italy.  The castle is built of hand-hewn native granite, and the stones were hoisted into place with a hand winch and held in place with rock wedging and clay mortar.  The kitchen and dining room were on the first floor, while the second floor contained the living room and the third floor housed two bedrooms.  Each of the floors had a fireplace, and the second and third floors each had a balcony.  The roof had a battlemented terrace.The family occupied the Stokes Castle for a short time.  The family traveled west in June 1897 with friends and spent about a month in the castle.  They spent a few more days in October 1897.  They returned in the summer of 1898, but they sold their mine, the milling equipment, and the castle, and never returned to the town.Eventually, the castle fell into disrepair until Molly Magee Knudsen, a cousin of Stokes, bought the castle in 1956.  The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.  The \"Castle\" was owned by HW Trapnell of Austin, NV and Dunsmuir, CA until he died on July 19, 2018.

        "short_description": "historic house in New York, United States",
        "long_description": "Stone Farmhouse is an historic home located at Buffalo in Erie County, New York.  It is a Greek Revival influenced stone vernacular farmhouse.  It is a two-story, rectangular hipped roof structure measuring approximately 40 feet wide and 50 feet deep.  It was built about 1830\u20131850 and is one of at least two stone houses in Buffalo surviving from the early 19th century.Discussion of when the Stone Farmhouse first appears in historical documents. According to the 1854 map \"Map of Erie County, New York : from actual surveys\" the three structures and associate names occurring east of Main St. and west of what would become Meech St. read from left to right as J.F. \"Schantztin\", D. \"Eragot\", and B. \"Rumsey\"; with J.J. \"Baldwin\" occurring between what would become the intersecting Meech St. and Oak Grove. This area of the city is not assigned a ward and for the 1840 and 1850 census is called \"Black Rock\". The 1850 Federal census in Black Rock, page 112, has the neighbor and brewer J.F \"Schentztin\" but \"D. Ergot/Eragot\" does not appear, nor do the immediate neighbors of \"Rumsey\" and Baldwin, however many neighbors at the corner of Delavan and Walden Ave. do. It's possible that this property was originally part of the brewery of J.F.\"Schentztin\". Based on the 1850 census these three properties are not present, though would make up the back yard of the brewery; but by 1854 all three properties are present on the survey map, with the \"Rumsey\" property in the 1860 census. A study of the deeds is needed.\nThe 1866 map by Stone & Stewart of the City of Buffalo shows one C.C.Curtiss (Charles. \"G.\" Curtiss B.1827) as owner of 60 Hedley place,1866 Map of the City of Buffalo Charles G. Curtiss is also in the 1865 New York Census, City of Buffalo, ward 12, page 21, as living with his wife Amelia G. Curtiss, four children, Charles's sister Emma and two female servants. The Curtiss house is listed as made of \"stone\".\nAccording to the 1870 Non-population New York Census on page 1, line 7, Amelia Curtiss is listed as head, with neighbor John Ambrose which concurs with the survey maps. There were 15 acres of improved and 5 acres of woodland. The property, dwelling and all were valued at $18,800; with the farm tools, etc. adding another $100 and $700 in wages were paid. There were 2 horse plus 1 milch cow valued at $400. There were 25 bushels of \"Indian corn\", 15 bushels of peas and beans, 100 bushels of Irish potatoes, and 30 bushels from an \"orchard\", and $600 worth of products from a market garden were produced. Plus 100 pounds of butter and 15 (bushels?) of hay. This was not one of the largest nor small farms as compared to the neighbors.\nFrom the \"Eleventh and Twelfth Wards\" from Buffalo 1872, New York map published by G.M. Hopkins & Co. shows that what would become the St. Vincents Orphanage in the 1880 map is being lived in by the Rail Road Engineer A.M. Curtiss, who later becomes the VP of RR in Buffalo, NY. The dash lines show where Jefferson St. will be constructed through one of the buildings.\nThe 1880 map of the City of Buffalo by F.W. Beers & Co. shows that the J.F. \"Schantstin\" building is between Main St. and Jefferson. To the east of Jefferson, of what was the \"Ergot\"-Curtiss house became the St. Vincent Female Orphanage and is set back from Delavan Ave. at roughly where 60 Hedley place is today. The B.C. \"Rumsey\" (Bronson C. Rumsey) is east of Meech St. and west of Oak Grove.1880 Map with buildings mark above Delavan Ave. \nThe Hedley Stone Farmhouse was likely set back from Delavan Ave. originally as the 1891 map by Rand, McNally & Company shows the eastern half of Hedley St. with a connection to Oak Grove (street) as having been constructed by the time of making the map. The Western half of Hedley St. connecting to Jefferson Ave. had not been constructed yet.Rand, McNally & Company 1891 map This area o the city is ward 12 from 1855 to 1890. Ward Map. It is part of ward 25 in 1893. Ward Map 1893\nAlthough neighborhood legend holds that it was used as slave quarters, all evidence indicates that it was built well after New York State abolished slavery in 1827.\nThe stone farmhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.  It is located in the Hamlin Park Historic District.",

It was the largest slave rebellion in the Southern Colonies, with 25 colonists and 35 to 50 African slaves killed.  The uprising's leaders were likely from the Central African Kingdom of Kongo, as they were Catholic and some spoke Portuguese.\nThe leader of the rebellion, Jemmy, was a literate enslaved man. In some reports, however, he is referred to as \"Cato\", and likely was held by the Cato (or Cater) family, who lived near the Ashley River and north of the Stono River. He led 20 other enslaved Kongolese, who may have been former soldiers, in an armed march south from the Stono River. They were bound for Spanish Florida, where successive proclamations had promised freedom for fugitive slaves from British North America.Jemmy and his group recruited nearly 60 other slaves and killed more than 20 whites before being intercepted and defeated by the South Carolina militia near the Edisto River. Survivors traveled another 30 miles (50 km) before the militia finally defeated them a week later.  Most of the captured slaves were executed; the surviving few were sold to markets in the West Indies. In response to the rebellion, the General Assembly passed the Negro Act of 1740, which restricted slaves' freedoms and placed a moratorium on importing new slaves.\n\n",

This status ended with a division of land among the taxpayers in 1720, with settlement following soon afterward.  Woodbridge Street was then the principal road between Hadley and Amherst, and was where a number of new homes were erected in the following years.  One of the district's oldest surviving structures, now the rear ell of 82 Woodbridge Street, was built by Joseph White in 1727.  The area remained agricultural into the 20th century, and benefited from the early preservation efforts of philanthropist Joseph Allen Skinner, who funded the restoration of a number of its houses in the early 20th century.The district includes properties from 25 through 82 Woodbridge Street, and at 3 and 7 Silver Street.  The majority of buildings in the district are houses that were built in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The site includes a picturesque 1.5 miles (2.4 km) oak avenue, the ruins of Jones' fortified house built of tabby, a museum, and a  demonstration area interpreting colonial daily life.\nIn 1736, Noble Jones obtained a grant for 500 acres (2.0 km2) of land on the Isle of Hope that would form the core of Wormsloe. He constructed a fortified house on the southeastern tip of the island overlooking the Skidaway Narrows, a strategic section of the Skidaway River located along the Intracoastal Waterway roughly halfway between downtown Savannah and the Atlantic Ocean. The fortified house was part of a network of defensive structures established by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and early Georgia colonists to protect Savannah from a potential Spanish invasion. Jones subsequently developed Wormsloe into a small plantation, and his descendants built a large mansion at the site which they used as a country residence.\nThe State of Georgia acquired the bulk of the Wormsloe Plantation in 1973, and opened it to the public as a state historic site in 1979.",

Along with the Brafferton and President's House, these buildings form the College's \"Ancient Campus.\" With a construction history dating to 1695, it is the oldest academic building still standing in the United States and among the oldest buildings in Virginia. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.Construction of the first building on this site began August 8, 1695 and was completed by 1700. The building, along with the rest of the historic courtyard, was built using enslaved labor. After several fires and rebuildings, the Wren Building was the first major building restored or reconstructed by John D. Rockefeller Jr., after he and the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin began Colonial Williamsburg's restoration in the late 1920s. The building's was restored in the 20th century by Boston architects Perry Shaw & Hepburn. The college named the building in honor of the English architect Sir Christopher Wren, after the Reverend Hugh Jones, a William and Mary mathematics professor, wrote in 1724 that the college building was \"modeled by Sir Christopher Wren\". However, it is unknown how Jones came to this conclusion, since there are no actual documents tying Wren to the building's design, and he never even visited North America. Perry Shaw and Hepburn's restoration reflects the building's historic appearance from its reconstruction in 1716 after a 1705 fire to 1859, when it burned again.\nThe building is constructed out of red brick in the style of Flemish and English Bond, as was typical for official buildings in 17th- and 18th-century Williamsburg, including several walls remaining from previous structures, and it contains classrooms, offices, a refectory, known as the Great Hall, kitchen, and a chapel, which was added as a south wing in 1732. The crypt beneath the chapel is the resting place of several notable Virginians, including royal governor Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt, Speaker of the House of Burgesses Sir John Randolph, and his son Peyton Randolph, the first President of the Continental Congress.On the top of the building is a weather vane with the number 1693, the year the College was founded. In the early 1770s, plans were drawn up to complete the building as a quadrangle. Alumnus Thomas Jefferson (class of 1762) drew up a floorplan submitted to Governor Dunmore and foundations were laid in 1774. The looming American Revolutionary War halted further construction, however, and the fourth wing was never completed. The foundations, however, still exist and were uncovered during excavations in 2014.The first and second floors of the building are still open for public viewing. Guided tours of the Wren Building are offered whenever classes are in-session by the Spotswood Society, named after Alexander Spotswood, an influential Virginia governor. The Spotswood Society also maintains a virtual tour.",

Formed during the middle of the 19th century, it worships in a prominent church building that has been named a historic site.\nIn the early 1840s (perhaps in 1841, but the date is uncertain), a Methodist Protestant minister formed a small religious society that worshipped in an old log schoolhouse near York Center.  Until 1844, the group met both in the schoolhouse and in a private residence, but in the latter year a decision was made to build a frame church building.  Growth over the next thirty years prompted the construction of a larger building on 1877, at a cost of $5,000; fully $3,000 of this total was donated by one woman, Mary Ford, from whose name was derived the church's nickname of \"Mary's Chapel\".:\u200a523\u200a  The previous building was sold and converted into a house, while a group of members later donated a separate house to the church for use as a parsonage.  Into the early twentieth century, this congregation was one of only two churches in York Township, along with a Congregationalist congregation founded in 1833.:\u200a524\u200aBuilt of brick, the church is a Romanesque Revival building divided into four bays on the sides and three on the front.  Tall windows fill the side bays and the left and right bays on the front, while a tower projects forward from the middle bay.  Windows and the main entrance pierce the ground floor of the tower, with a wheel window and normal windows on higher stories; thanks to its spire, the tower is the tallest section of the building.  Aside from the tower, the building was historically an ordinary rectangle in its floor plan, but the southern side (rear end) of the building was modified in the 1960s by the construction of an addition for classroom space.  Although it was erected in the late 1870s, the building displays the style of an older era: carpenter Thomas Rogers, who was both architect and general contractor, produced a building reminiscent of Romanesque Revival churches from the beginning of the 19th century, at which time the Greek Revival style was far more popular in Ohio.In early 1978, the church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its important architecture and because of the place it has played in the history of Mallet Creek and the surrounding area.  Today, the congregation remains an active part of the East Ohio Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church.\n\n",

The building was designed by architects Raymond E. Bales, Jr. and Morris Schechter and built by the Long Construction Company of Kansas City; site work began in May 1955, and construction was completed on October 31, 1956. The building's exterior was decorated in TWA's signature red and white corporate colors. The three-story L-shaped commercial facility was dominated by aluminum panels and corrugated concrete paneling. It was constructed using the Youtz-Slick construction method, in which steel support beams were first erected and then concrete slabs were poured at ground level and lifted into place by hydraulic jacks; the slabs were then bolted and welded onto the beams, which allowed for a reduction in construction costs and construction time.\nBy 1964 TWA had become a major international figure in aviation, which prompted a move of the airline's executive offices to New York City. The 1735 Baltimore building remained the headquarters for TWA's accounting department, ticket office, credit department, and cargo department until 1969; the airline continued to use the building for training its flight attendants until opening the Breech Academy in nearby suburban Overland Park, KS in 1969.\nIn 2002 the TWA building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It had been vacant for several years, though plans as late as 2003 called for it to be converted to residential condominiums under the name of TWA Lofts LLC. Instead, in early 2005, the Kansas City-based urban development firm The Nicholson Group hired local architectural firm el dorado inc to design and coordinate the restoration. Following the renovation, it was then leased to the Kansas City-based advertising agency Barkley Inc.; the agency moved into the renovated building on November 14, 2006.",

It was designated as a Michigan Historic Site on January 16, 1976, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 17, 1986.\nSettled in as early as the 1820s, the Tecumseh Downtown Historic District centers on the intersection of Evans Street and Chicago Boulevard (M-50).  Evans Street contains only two contributing properties from 115 to 125 South Evans Street, while no portions of North Evans Street north of M-50 are included in the district.  The majority of the district is on M-50, consisting of 102\u2013128 West Chicago Boulevard and 101\u2013154 East Chicago Boulevard.  There are a total of 31 contributing properties and eight non-contributing properties.The two-block-long district consists primarily of two to four-story Italianate buildings dating primarily from 1850 to 1900.  In 1824, Tecumseh pioneer Musgrove Evans platted the village with the intent of Chicago Boulevard (then known as the Chicago Road) to be the main thoroughfare through the village.  After being settled, Tecumseh was designated as the county seat of the newly established Lenawee County.  Its growth also relied heavily on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway line running through the area.  Tecumseh developed rapidly as the county seat from 1826 to 1838.  The government then moved to Adrian, and Tecumseh's expansion halted.  Because of this lack of later development, much of the downtown area has been preserved.  The railway line still runs through the center of the district but has long been in disuse.",

Much of Fourth and Gill was initially part of the separate city of North Knoxville, which was annexed by Knoxville in 1897.

The dam and gatehouse are located at the southeastern end of Framingham Reservoir No. 3, off Massachusetts Route 9.  They were built 1876\u201378 as part of an expansion of the public water supply of the city of Boston.  The dam is 2,280 feet (690 m) long, and impounds an area of 253 acres (102 ha) in the Sudbury River watershed.  The reservoir is the largest of the three Framingham reservoirs that were built at that time.  The dam's core is constructed of granite rubble laid in cement.  There is a granite-lined overfall area 100 feet (30 m) long, which was originally topped by flashboards.  At the end of the overfall area nearest Route 9 stands the gatehouse, a granite structure with a rectangular main block and a smaller wing.  Both sections have a steeply pitched slate roof.  The door is in a round-arch recess, and the building is capped by a cupola.  It houses controls for two 4-foot (1.2 m) mains connected to the Sudbury Aqueduct via the gatehouse at  Reservoir No. 1. The water is directed either directly beyond the dam into reservoir 1 or through the 4-foot mains to the Sudbury Aqueduct gatehouse.The dam was built by contractors from Worcester, and the gatehouse was built by Benjamin Dewing of Boston to a design by the Boston city architect, George Clough.  Since its construction, the reservoir, which is also known as the Foss Reservoir, has been connected by an open channel to the Sudbury Reservoir (in 1898), and had its shore areas resurfaced (in 1907\u201308). Nearly all of the reservoir's water comes from the Sudbury Reservoir as its own natural watershed is very limited. Of the Framingham Reservoirs, Reservoir #3 is the only one that was regularly used throughout its time as an active water source due to its better water quality than the reservoirs to the south. The reservoir is no longer in active service though it is maintained as an emergency source. It is the only one of the Framingham reservoirs still maintained as an emergency source.  The dam and gatehouse were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.",

        "long_description": "The John Bowne House is a house in Flushing, Queens, New York City, that is known for its role in establishing religious tolerance in the United States.\nBuilt around 1661, it was the location of a Quaker meeting in 1662 that resulted in the arrest of its owner, John Bowne, by Peter Stuyvesant, Dutch Director-General of New Netherland. Bowne successfully appealed his arrest to the Dutch West India Company and established a precedent for religious tolerance and freedom in the colony. His appeal helped to serve as the basis for the later guarantees of freedom of religion, speech and right of assembly in the Constitution.\nMany of John Bowne's descendants engaged in abolitionist anti-slavery activism. For example, John's great-grandson Robert Bowne was an early founder with Alexander Hamilton and others of the Manumission Society of New York in 1784. Some of its residents such as Mary Bowne Parsons\u2019 son William B. Parsons have also been documented as acting as conductors assisting fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad prior to the American Civil War.\nThe home is a wood-frame Anglo-Dutch Colonial saltbox, notable for its steeply pitched roof with three dormers. The house was altered several times over the centuries, and several generations of the Bowne family lived in the house until 1945, when the family deeded the property to the Bowne Historical Society. The Bowne House became a museum in 1947. The exterior has since been renovated. Archaeological investigations have been conducted by Dr. James A. Moore of Queens College, City University of New York.The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and is also a New York City designated landmark.",

        "long_description": "The Cincinnati and Whitewater Canal Tunnel is a historic yet abandoned canal tunnel in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Located within the village of Cleves near Cincinnati, it was constructed in 1837 as part of the Whitewater Canal system.  Since the canal's closure, it has largely been forgotten, but it has been designated a historic site.\nAfter Indiana began building the Whitewater Canal in the 1830s, Ohio businessmen urged the construction of an extension from the canal to Cincinnati.  The resulting Cincinnati and Whitewater Canal was completed in 1843, including a canal tunnel near the village of North Bend, which was finished six years before the canal opened for business.  This tunnel was needed because of a steep ridgeline on the village's northern side, separating it from Cleves, on land owned by retired war hero William Henry Harrison, who as one of the canal's proponents was happy to sell land for its right-of-way and to supply wood and bricks for the tunnel.  After his ascension to the presidency and sudden death, Harrison was buried atop the ridgeline near the tunnel's southern portal.Lined with brick, the tunnel includes ashlar stonework portals with wing walls.  Upon completion, the tunnel was 0.3 miles (0.48 km) long, and there was 22 feet (6.7 m) between the ceiling and the underwater bottom of the canal.  Unusually, the tunnel included room for a towpath instead of requiring the use of leggers, but the typical canal boat nevertheless relied on manpower while allowing the beasts of burden to climb the hill.  As the state's first tunnel of its type, the Cincinnati and Whitewater Canal Tunnel has suffered two separate collapse incidents.  The first occurred during the construction process, and six workmen died, while another segment caved in during the 1950s during a project to improve the portion of U.S. Route 50 that travels over the tunnel.Despite the efforts spent on building the Whitewater Canal, it was abandoned in 1856 after numerous floods had destroyed much of its length.  This resulted in the abandonment of the canal tunnel, a period of stagnation that ended in 1863 when a railroad company began a twenty-five-year period of using it as an ordinary rail tunnel.  Since the rail line was rerouted in 1888, the tunnel has become completely unusable, having silted up almost all the way to the ceiling.  However, the tunnel has not been completely forgotten; the Ohio Historical Society and a group of private organizations placed a historical marker by the tunnel's northern portal in 2000, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in mid-2001.  Its historic significance derives from its rarity: only a handful of canal tunnels were ever built in the United States.",

The original house was moved to the back of the property to make room for four additional two-story residential buildings.  The buildings provided housing for those employed in the booming film industry, and its residents are rumored to have included Theda Bara in the 1920s and Sylvia Sidney in the 1930s.In 1974, the buildings were converted to a mix of residential and office space.

The private home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on May 14, 2004.\nThe house was built in 1910 for Charles A. Canfield.  Canfield, alongside business partner Edward L. Doheny, became an oil tycoon after drilling the first successful oil well in Los Angeles in 1892.  The two would go on to also drill the first oil well in Mexico, using the resulting asphalt to pave Mexican roads and standing as a precursor to Pemex.  The partners' work became part of the basis of Upton Sinclair's Oil! and related film There Will Be Blood.  Canfield convinced the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to switch from coal to oil-burning locomotives. He ultimately invested his wealth in real estate.  Forming the Rodeo Land and Water Company in Los Angeles with Burton E. Green and Max Whittier and the South Coast Land Company in Del Mar with Henry E. Huntington and other partners, he helped establish both Beverly Hills, California and Del Mar.Intending the house as a second home, Canfield chose architect John C. Austin, who would also design the Southern Land Company's Hotel Del Mar and go on to design major Southern California landmarks such as Los Angeles City Hall and the Griffith Observatory.  The house was designed in the Mission and Spanish Revival styles with influences of an Italian villa and sited with a view of the Pacific Ocean.Canfield died in 1913. The house stayed in the Canfield family until 1923, when it was sold to the Wright family.  The structure was only minimally altered: small additions were made to the main residence and outbuildings, and a large retaining wall was added to the property.  By the end of the twentieth century, the structure was being rented and had been painted a bright pink.  In 2002, a developer requested permission to treat the property as a teardown to replace it with a contemporary structure.  The proposal galvanized local residents to try to preserve the structure; their actions included filing a nomination for the building to be placed on the NRHP.  Helped by groups such as the Save Our Heritage Organisation, citizens pressured the City of Del Mar, which previously had no preservation ordinances or incentives for preservation, in city council and design review board meetings, delaying the permit.  Within six months of the house's being threatened with demolition, a new owner stepped forward to purchase the property and restore it.  The new owner, a developer who lived nearby, presented development plans that were judged to be in compliance with historic-preservation guidelines.  The home was restored over a four-year period from 2004 to 2008.  It remains a private residence, currently owned by Marc and Patty Brutten.",

Capon Chapel is one of the oldest existing log churches in Hampshire County, along with Mount Bethel Church and Old Pine Church.\nA Baptist congregation was gathering at the site of the present-day church by at least 1756. Primitive Baptist minister John Monroe (1750\u20131824) is credited for establishing a place of worship at this site; he is interred in the church's cemetery. The land on which Capon Chapel was built originally belonged to William C. Nixon (1789\u20131869), a member of the Virginia House of Delegates; later, it was transferred to the Pugh family. The first documented mention of a church at the Capon Chapel site was in March 1852, when Joseph Pugh allocated the land to three trustees for the construction of a church and cemetery.\nDuring the early years of Capon Chapel, no Protestant denomination was the exclusive owner or occupant, and the church was probably utilized as a \"union church\" for worship by any Christian denomination. Capon Chapel was used as a place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century. In the 1890s, Capon Chapel was added as a place of worship on the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit of the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church. As of 2017, Capon Chapel remains a Methodist church, now a part of the United Methodist Church, holding Methodist services four Sundays per month at 1pm. Open table communion is held on the first Sunday of each month. Capon Chapel also maintains a daily devotion hotline.\nCapon Chapel's cemetery is surrounded by a wrought iron fence made by Stewart Iron Works, and contains the remains of John Monroe, William C. Nixon, West Virginia House of Delegates member Captain David Pugh (1806\u20131899), American Civil War veterans from the Union and the Confederacy, and free and enslaved African Americans. Capon Chapel, along with its cemetery, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, in recognition of its representation of the rural religious architecture of the Potomac Highlands region, and for its service as an important rural church in Hampshire County.",

The southern entry is slightly more elegant, with flanking pilasters and a transom window.  The house was built sometime before 1755, and was already a well-known landmark because it was (unusually for the time) painted, and served as a tavern on the coach road.  The Tavern served as a meeting place for many revolutionaries and minute men, notably  Marquis de Lafayette, and Alexander Hamilton.  The house remained in the hands of militia captain Nathaniel Parker and his descendants into the late 19th century.  The construction of the Andover Turnpike (now Main Street) in 1806\u201307, bypassing its location, prompted a decline in the tavern's business.The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.",

It was one of many public and college libraries funded by Andrew Carnegie, which were named Carnegie Library after him. It is the oldest brick building on the campus and the first Carnegie Library to be built on a black land-grant college campus.Carnegie's library was built at what is today FAMU because the city of Tallahassee refused it, since under Carnegie's rules it would have had to serve black patrons (see History of Tallahassee, Florida#Black history). At the time, FAMU's predecessor, the State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students, was in need of a new library. Its library had been located in the mansion of Florida Governor William Pope Duval, which burned in 1905. The Carnegie Library was built on the site of that mansion.\nIt was designed by architect William Augustus Edwards and was built in 1908.

In 2006 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; five years later it was designated a town landmark as well.While it is a fine example of its school of architecture, the house's primary historical value is that it was the home of suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt and her partner Mary Hay from 1919 to 1928. That period was the height of her activism; it began with the passage and ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, and continued with her founding of the League of Women Voters and advocacy of women's suffrage in other countries.\nShe found the house an ideal place to rest her \"tired nerves\" since the land was too steep to farm productively. However, later on she did start limited farming, including raising cattle and chickens, on the land, and made some significant modifications to the property. She also claimed to a group of guests during the early years of Prohibition that she had bought the land to prevent anyone from using its juniper berries to make gin.After nine years, she and Hay, who had never embraced the rural lifestyle, moved out. The land has been further subdivided but the house remains largely intact. It is still a private residence. Composer Carmino Ravosa, who learned of Catt's residence there while researching a musical, has worked to preserve it.",

The swing span is mounted on a central pier, and is rotated by two workers operating a large hickory handle. The bridge was built in 1932\u201333, with the swing span design made to accommodate the demands of the United States War Department that the river remain navigable by military vessels. The bridge is one of three swing-span bridges in the state. It is likely that the swinging mechanism has never been used.The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.",

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 26, 1980.",

It is a well-preserved example of the academic Italianate style of architecture, with a three-bay facade and hip roof with a small gable over the centered entry, and a three-story turret. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.The Mount Pleasant house was built for Roswell Turner, a major land owner and real estate developer in the Newton Centre area.  The house and surrounding property were owned for many of the later years of the 19th century and early years of the 20th century by Charles S. Davis, another major force in the development of Newton Centre.  Under Davis's ownership, much of the original estate was split off for other houses and streets to be built, while the original Mount Pleasant house remained.  By 1917, Mr. Addison C. Burnham owned the house and was calling his smaller property \"Jolly's Hollow\". Subsequent owners continued to call it \"Jolly's Hollow\", at least into 2018.In January 1997, the Wilson family, owners of Jolly's Hollow/Mount Pleasant, donated 0.5 acres of the wooded portion of their property to the City of Newton for the creation of the Wilson Conservation Area.  In 2012, the Wilsons donated to the Newton Conservators a conservation restriction to preserve an additional 1.5 acres of their land.  This conservation land, as intended, adds a link to a popular walking trail that connects a playground, elementary school, and park nearby, and also to suburbs to the west. The walking trail is on top of the underground Cochituate and Sudbury Aqueducts (built in 1848 and 1878, respectively, to supply water to Boston and nearby municipalities).  The Mount Pleasant house happens to be situated right between the two aqueducts, which both have easements under the Jolly's Hollow property.The Wilsons sold the house and property in July 2018 to the Fiete family, having originally purchased it from the Scribner family in March 1966.",

Built in the early twentieth century, it has been named a historic site.\nMiddleport was founded as \"Sheffield\" during the 1820s, a time of great prosperity and rapidly increasing commerce in Meigs County.  Among its earliest industries was a cotton mill, built despite the lack of cotton production in the vicinity.  Local residents formed the village's first public library in 1908, but its initial location on the second floor of a commercial building soon proved unsatisfactory.  One year later, the library's board contacted Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie Corporation in order to begin participating in its library construction program.  Negotiations ultimately resulted in the foundation agreeing to provide the village with construction money, and the building was completed in 1912 under the direction of Athens contractor Charles Kirchner.The Middleport library is a brick building with a tiled roof and a brick foundation.  Its architecture is generally simple, although some details of the facade display a Georgian Revival architectural flavor; some of the more ornate examples are the pediment above the portico, the quoins, and the dentils underneath the pediment and the cornice.  In January 1986, the library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It qualified for inclusion under two different criteria: its architecture, which makes the library Middleport's most distinctive public building, and for its place in local history \u2014 besides its status as an example of small-town Carnegie libraries, it remained an icon of Middleport's early twentieth-century community activities.  The library is one of three Middleport locations on the National Register, along with the John Downing Jr. House and the William H.

Built in several phases during the 18th and 19th centuries, the plantation was the primary residence of several generations of the Middleton family, many of whom played prominent roles in the colonial and antebellum history of South Carolina. The plantation, now a National Historic Landmark District, is used as a museum, and is home to the oldest landscaped gardens in the United States.John Williams, an early South Carolina planter, probably began building Middleton Place in the late 1730s. His son-in-law Henry Middleton (1717\u20131784), who later served as President of the First Continental Congress, completed the house's main section and its north and south flankers, and began work on the elaborate gardens. Middleton's son, Founding Father  Arthur Middleton (1742\u20131787), a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was born at Middleton Place, and lived at the plantation during the last years of his life. Arthur Middleton's son and grandson, Henry Middleton (1770\u20141846) and Williams Middleton (1809\u20131883), oversaw Middleton Place's transition from a country residence to a more active rice plantation. In 1865, toward the end of the American Civil War, Union soldiers burned most of the house, leaving only the south wing and gutted walls of the north wing and main house. The 1886 Charleston earthquake toppled the walls of the main house and north wing.The restoration of Middleton Place began in 1916 when Middleton descendant John Julius Pringle Smith (1887\u20131969) and his wife Heningham began several decades' work of meticulously rebuilding the plantation's gardens. They had New York architect Bancel LaFarge design a stableyard complex of barn, stable, work buildings, and cottages; the buildings were constructed of brick salvaged from the ruined main house. In the early 1970s, approximately 110 acres (45 ha) of the 7,000-acre (2,800 ha) plantation\u2014including the south flanker, the gardens, and several outbuildings\u2014were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. During the same period the Middleton descendants transferred ownership of the historic district to the non-profit Middleton Place Foundation, which presently maintains the site.",

The park preserves habitation sites and mound groups, believed to date between 3000 BC and 1750 AD, that document Dakota Indian culture and Ojibwe-Dakota relationships.  The park contains 19 identified archaeological sites, making it one of the most significant archaeological collections in Minnesota.  The earliest site dates to the Archaic period and shows evidence of copper tool manufacture.  The Dakota lived in this area roughly until the 18th century, when many bands of them were moving southward into the prairies and river areas of southern Minnesota.  At the same time, Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) were moving in from the east.  Ojibwe oral tradition, published by William Whipple Warren, suggests that there was a battle in which they successfully took control of the area from the Lakota.\nAround the time of contact in the 1850s, loggers came to the area.  The next 50 years resulted in a large quantity of trees being felled and floated down the Rum River or across Mille Lacs Lake to sawmills.\nThe name \"Kathio\" is actually a corruption of \"Izatys\", a name the Mdewakanton Dakota people gave themselves.  Explorer Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut visited the area in 1679.  He named the area \"Izatys\", but his poor handwriting led people to mistake the \"Iz\" as a \"K\".  Further errors led to the name being transliterated to \"Kathio\".\nThe Kathio Historic District site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n",

One of the oldest houses in the area, it has been named a historic site.\nWhen Columbia was founded in 1788 as Hamilton County's first settlement, the pioneers spread out as far upriver as today's Anderson Township.  Land in the township, including the location of the Miller\u2013Leuser House, was surveyed five years later as part of a general survey of the Virginia Military District.  In 1796, explorer Nathaniel Massie purchased the site of the present house and quickly devised it to Ichabod Miller; he is believed to have constructed the house by the end of the year, and he retained ownership until selling it in 1836.  The cabin remained in residential use until 1971, when it was bought by the Anderson Township Historical Society; as one of the oldest buildings in southwestern Ohio, and as a typical component of the pioneer built environment, locals deemed it a highly significant part of their history.In building his house, Ichabod Miller employed a mix of logs: some were hand-hewn, while others retained their original round shape, and all are notched to enable them to fit together at the corners.  The entire building is one and one half stories tall.In 1974, the Miller\u2013Leuser Log House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, one of more than three hundred such locations in Hamilton County.  It qualified for inclusion primarily because of its architecture, rather than because of its place in local history.  The house is one of twelve National Register locations in Anderson Township, along with one house in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Cincinnati, three sites in the village of Newtown, and seven other places in the unincorporated portions of the township.",

Inside, the rooms open onto a central hallway that concludes with a stairway to the second floor of the central part of the house.In 1974, the Monitor House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its unusual architecture.  Only two or three monitor houses, featuring an elevated center, are known to exist in Ohio, and the one in St. Paris is architecturally the most well-preserved; consequently, it is considered historically significant statewide.  In contrast, a similar monitor house in Chillicothe, known as \"Tanglewood,\" is only considered locally significant.

The Montauk Association as an entity no longer exists.  The district also includes the sites of two former buildings of the Montauk Association, a community laundry and a community stable, which remain as archeological sites.  Another former building, the casino and clubhouse of the association, was burned in 1933 and has been replaced by a modern house, the Tweed House.  Another modern house, the Wright House, stands separately to the northwest of the complex of cottages.  There are also several small sheds and garages which are unobtrusive and do not unduly detract.The seven cottages are:\nAgnew Cottage (1884)\nBenson House (1883)\nSanger House (1883)\nHoyt House (1883)\nAndrews House (1884)\nde Forest House (1882)\nOrr House (1883)All seven were designed by McKim, Mead and White and are placed carefully in the natural landscape, conforming to a site plan designed by landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted.

The bridge is 344 feet (105 m) long, and was designed by Carl F. Gould, one of the original architects of the University of Washington campus. The bridge and its control towers were designed in conjunction with the university's Collegiate Gothic style. It provides a clearance of 46 feet (14 m) and is reported as providing 48 feet (15 m) of vertical clearance above the mean regulated level of Lake Washington for the central 100 feet (30 m) of the bascule span. It is one of four original bascule-type drawbridges over the Ship Canal, the others being the Ballard, Fremont, and University bridges. It was the last one to be completed, has the highest clearance of the four, and is the only one that is part of the state highway system. It is also one of six bascule bridges based on a design derived from the Chicago bascule bridge, but is unique because of its trunnion supports, employed to avoid a patent infringement lawsuit by the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company.\n\nPiers and abutments for a permanent bridge were built in 1914 as part of construction for the Ship Canal, but a serious proposal for a bridge at Montlake didn't come until 1916. The first bridge in its place was a makeshift walkway made from a series of barges, set up by graduate manager Dar Meisnest to allow football fans to cross for the Washington/Dartmouth game in 1920. The temporary bridge was so heavily traveled, it demonstrated the need for a permanent structure, which was finished in June 1925. The permanent bridge was opened on June 27, 1925, a month ahead of schedule and as the centerpiece for a local parade that drew thousands of residents.\nA report from 1993 states that the Montlake Bridge averaged a volume of 60,900 vehicles each weekday, while another report from 2001 puts normal weekend traffic across the bridge at about 40,000 vehicles each day. In addition to the vehicular traffic, the bridge conveys pedestrians and bicyclists across the canal by way of sidewalks on each side of the roadway. The bridge does not open during morning and evening rush hours. It opens at designated times (usually on the hour and half-hour) during the hours just prior to and after rush periods, and on demand at other times. The bridge openings last for an average of four minutes from when traffic stops to when it resumes again. Most of the openings are for sailboats, as most of the tugs that operate this far east are able to pass under the bridge in its closed position. The bridge creates a bottleneck for traffic heading to and from State Route 520 (SR-520), and the creation of alternate routes has been proposed multiple times over the years. Traffic can become backed up for more than a mile when the bridge is open, as can be seen in aerial photographs. Plans to replace SR-520 include adding a second bascule bridge across the Montlake Cut next to the current Montlake Bridge.",

The Leominster Historical Society headquarters is adjacent to the square.\nIn 1743 the common was chosen as the site of the \"First Church\" meeting house in Leominster. At that time, an active church congregation was required for a town to gain a charter from the Massachusetts government. Originally a Congregationalist (Puritan) congregation, First Church's members later adopted a Unitarian theology in the early 19th century, causing the traditional Reformed (Calvinist) members to leave the building and found what is now Pilgrim Congregational Church, also located on the common. The First Church congregation was funded with state tax revenue until 1835, when Massachusetts separated its churches from state funding.The historic district also contains many 19th-century  buildings, and the area was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

One of the area's first houses designed by master architect Samuel Hannaford, the elaborate brick house was home to the owner of a prominent food-processing firm, and it has been named a historic site.\nBorn in 1838, Thomas Morrison left his native County Antrim in 1860, where he quickly found employment with Morrison and Cardukes, one of Cincinnati's numerous pork packing firms.  After working for the company for nearly forty years, he became the owner in 1897, and under his leadership the company outgrew nearly all of its competitors and became one of the first American meat packing firms to export its products to the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe.  Morrison was married to the daughter of William Procter, co-founder of Procter & Gamble.One of Samuel Hannaford's earlier houses in the Cincinnati metropolitan area, the Morrison House was constructed in 1873 and saw the last details added in 1875; it postdated Hannaford's own residence by approximately ten years, but the architect was still comparatively little known when the Morrison House was completed.:\u200a4\u200a  However, following his Music Hall of Music Hall in the late 1870s, Hannaford became one of Cincinnati's most prominent architects; by the end of the century, the Morrison House was one of several Hannaford designs in the neighborhood of Clifton, and numerous grand Hannaford houses could be found throughout other wealthy neighborhoods such as Walnut Hills and Avondale.:\u200a10\u200aTwo and a half stories tall,:\u200a4\u200a the Morrison House is a brick building with a slate roof and additional elements of wood and stone.  The center of the facade includes a three-story tower projecting forward from the rest of the building, while large dormer windows are placed in the roof on either side of the tower.  Each bay of the second and third floors is pierced by a pair of windows, while an elaborate porch fills the first floor of the facade: the sides of the porch are wooden with extensive spindlework, while the center features a large sandstone archway with Corinthian columns.  These elements combine to give it an Italianate appearance, although with influence from other styles; this reflects Hannaford's employment of numerous architectural styles through his career.:\u200a12\u200aIn 1973, the Morrison House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its architecture.  Seven years later, it was included in a multiple property submission of dozens of Hannaford-designed buildings in Hamilton County, one of few in the grouping that were already on the Register.",

Cedar Lawn was built in 1825 for John Thornton Augustine Washington, George Washington's grand-nephew.  The property was originally part of the Harewood estate belonging to Samuel Washington.  The property that eventually became Cedar Lawn was left to Samuel's son, Thornton Washington, who built \"Berry Hill\", named for his wife's family. Berry Hill was destroyed by fire, and John Thornton Augustine built Cedar Lawn when he inherited.In the 1940s, the house was bought by R.J. Funkhouser, an industrialist who had a taste for Washington family estates, who also owned Blakeley and Claymont Court.  The property remains in the Funkhouser family and is known as O'Sullivan Farms, after Funkhouser's principal venture, the O'Sullivan Corporation.",

Despite being extensively rebuilt in the early 20th century, the complex has an appearance that is more typical of 19th century mills.The Central Manufacturing Company was established in 1837, and was one of Southbridge's major employers well into the 20th century.  The company built its premises on the site of Southbridge's earliest grist- and sawmills, and the town grew around the facility.  By late in the 19th century most New England textile mills were in decline, due to increased competition in the South.  However, Central Manufacturing embarked on a major renovation of its plant in 1908.  It knocked a significant portion of the 1837 plant, and built the present two story brick structure, with the surviving 1837 section attached to its rear.  The building is in the Romanesque Revival style, with rounded arch windows and a small tower.In addition to the main factory building, there are two other buildings in the complex.  One is a small single story office building, also built in 1908 and with Romanesque Revival styling.  This building is on the same parcel as the main building.

It served as a storage place for weapons, ordnance, and ammunition for the U.S. Army in antebellum days. (An earlier Federal arsenal, the Old Citadel, was taken out of service and after became a part of The Citadel.) The Charleston arsenal produced a considerable amount of artillery and small arms ammunition during the Mexican\u2013American War and up to the Civil War.\nWith the secession of South Carolina in December 1860, the Arsenal became a target for Charleston militia. South Carolina troops seized the arsenal in late December, and the Confederates held it for much of the war. Josiah Gorgas had the arsenal enlarged and modernized with the installation of steam power. For a time, it was used a barracks to house Confederate troops, including the 26th South Carolina. The arsenal was retaken by Union troops in 1865 when Charleston finally fell.\nOn July 16, 1866, the U.S. government designated the 11.26-acre (4.56 ha) site as a Federal Military Reservation, but in 1879 the Army closed the arsenal. The building and land were sold in 1888, to the Porter Military Academy which occupied the site until it built a new campus west of the Ashley River, and in 1963 the site became part of the Medical University of South Carolina.",

It was a complement to the then-whites-only Kentucky Lake State Park (now Kenlake State Resort Park), which was nearby.  It was built by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which went along with the concept of the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.  The TVA gave the state of Kentucky a nineteen-year lease, and promised to give Kentucky the area when it proved it could support the park.  In its time it was dubbed \"the finest colored vacation site in the South.\"  This sentiment was echoed in a 1952 Kentucky state map.Opened in 1951, Cherokee State Park was the third blacks-only state park and the first such state park in Kentucky and the Southern United States.  It was the only blacks-only state park Kentucky had.With a size of 300 acres (1.2 km2), Cherokee State Park had several amenities.  These included a 200-person dining hall (1953), docks for fishing and boating, picnicking, a bathhouse for the lake's beach, and a restaurant.  There was also twelve cottages (1953) for overnight lodging.  It drew visitors from Western Kentucky, Southern Illinois, and Northern Kentucky.  Sand often had to be brought in to keep the beach usable, as it was rocky in nature.With the desegregation movements in the 1960s, Cherokee State Park was closed, and its cottages moved to Kenlake.  In 1998 the sculling team of nearby Murray State University used the property to highlight its many rewards, but did nothing to note its history.  It is now part of Kenlake State Resort Park.  Few of the original buildings remain, but there are plans to reopen the area.On January 9, 2009, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n",

The building was designed by Frost & Granger in 1909; it was mainly designed in the Beaux Arts style but also exhibits elements of the Italian Renaissance Revival style. Construction on the building finished in 1911, the same year the terminal opened. The irregularly shaped building borders Clinton Street, Milwaukee Avenue, Lake Street, and the former Chicago and North Western tracks, which are now used by Metra for its Union Pacific District. The power house was built in cream brick with terra cotta trim, cornices, and ornamentation; the corner of the house at Clinton and Milwaukee features a 227-foot (69 m) brick smokestack. The building contained four rooms, a large engine room and boiler room and a smaller engineer's office and reception room. The Chicago Tribune reported in 1948 that the power house output enough power to serve a city of 15,000 people. The power house ceased to serve the station in the 1960s, but when the terminal was demolished and replaced by Ogilvie Transportation Center in 1984, the power house survived. It is one of two remaining railroad power houses in Chicago and the only remaining power house for the Chicago and North Western.The power house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 2004. It was designated as a Chicago Landmark on January 11, 2006.Prior to its designation as a landmark, the building had long been slated for demolition, and its sub-basements were damaged by the 1992 Chicago Flood. A real estate developer purchased the building and, by adding two additional interior floors, re-developed the structure into a mixed-use office and retail building. The renovations won the Best Adaptive Reuse award from Landmarks Illinois in 2007.\n\n",

It was built to provide California with high-quality cotton. Initial research at the station focused on growing long-staple cotton, Egyptian Pima cotton, which was used to make airplane wings at the time. The Hatch Act of 1887 provided for U.S. funding of agricultural science.\nBy 1925, the researchers had determined that Acala cotton, named after Acala, Texas, was the highest-quality variety of long-staple cotton; they then developed the \"one variety\" method of cotton production, in which every California cotton producer would grow Acala cotton. As a result of this research, the state of California enacted the California One Variety Cotton Act, which mandated that California cotton producers could grow only Acala cotton. The law spurred the growth of California's fledgling cotton industry, which now forms a major part of the state's agricultural economy. The success of the \"one variety\" policy caused the station to earn an international reputation for its research, and procedures developed at the station have been used in the Australian and Israeli cotton industries.\nThe Shafter Cotton Research Station changed from a USDA research station to a private one in June 2012. The San Joaquin Valley Quality Cotton Growers Association now runs the facility. With this change, the former Shafter Cotton Research Station now works other crops, including orchard crops. Today the facility consists of a 20-acre campus, 20 buildings and 60 acres of experimental crops.The Shafter Research Station was made a California Historical Landmark (#1022) on March 3, 1997, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 17, 1997.\nThe California Historical Landmark plaque reads:NO. 1022 SHAFTER COTTON RESEARCH STATION - The Shafter Cotton Research Station, established here in 1922 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, developed the \"Acala\" varieties which were exceptionally well suited to the San Joaquin Valley. The quality of the Acala cottons and the marketing advantage of the one variety cotton district, created in 1925, resulted in premium cottons with a world-wide demand. Through the continued vision and cooperative efforts of growers and researchers, production of Acala cotton became one of California's largest agricultural enterprises.",

On December 30, 1992, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The \"AME\" is an abbreviation of African Methodist Episcopal, the religious denomination.\nAfter the Civil War, several dozen Freedmen organized a \"Society\" for the purpose of religious worship.  On July 28, 1866, this group became formally recognized as Mount Zion A.M.E. Church. The church acquired the property at the northeast corner of Beaver and Newnan Streets, and a small frame structure was built for worship services on that site.  In 1870 a large wooden church was built, and twenty years later an even larger brick sanctuary, with a seating capacity of nearly 1,500, was built at this location.\nWithin four months after the Great Fire of 1901 destroyed that building, plans for the present church were under way.  According to a September, 1901 newspaper report, the Romanesque Revival style structure was estimated to cost $18,000.  Architectural details such as arched window and door openings, art-glass windows, a bell tower, contrasting brick quoins, and a crenelated parapet contribute to its handsome design. The building was completed in 1905 and was designed by architects J. B. Carr & Co. of Birmingham and Francis J. Norton of Jacksonville & Chicago.",

Hunt opened The Grove Hotel during this era and developed onsite cottages that served as rental properties. After a brief period under the ownership of John W.

In September 1814, after British forces burnt the White House during the War of 1812, for six months the Octagon House served as the residence of United States president James Madison and first lady Dolley Madison. It is one of only five houses to serve as the presidential residence in the history of the United States of America, and one of only three, along with the White House and Blair House, that still stand.\nJohn Tayloe III was born at Mount Airy, which he later inherited. The colonial estate was built by his father, John Tayloe II, on the north bank of the Rappahannock River across from Tappahannock, Virginia. By this time, it was the centerpiece of a roughly 60,000 acre department of interdependent plantation farms known as the Mount Airy department, located approximately one hundred miles south of Washington, D.C., in Richmond County, Virginia. He was educated at Eton College and Cambridge University in England, served in the Virginia state legislature, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1800.\nJohn Tayloe III married Ann Ogle, daughter of Benjamin Ogle and granddaughter to Samuel Ogle of Ogle Hall Annapolis, Maryland, in 1792 at her family's country home Belair Mansion. Ann was only a year younger than her husband. Tayloe was reputed to be the richest Virginian planter of his time, and built the house in Washington at the suggestion of George Washington on land purchased from Gustavus W. Scott or Benjamin Stoddert, first Secretary of the Navy. The Octagon was originally constructed to be a winter residence for the Tayloe family, but they lived in the house year-round from 1818 to 1855. The Octagon property originally included a number of outbuildings, including a smokehouse, laundry, stables, carriage house, slave quarters, and an ice house (the only surviving outbuilding). The Tayloes were involved in shipbuilding, horse breeding and racing, and owned several iron foundries\u2014they were fairly diversified for a plantation family. The Tayloes enslaved hundreds of people, and had between 12 and 18 who worked at the Octagon.",

The Italian Renaissance-style mansion was commissioned by Joseph Theurer, then-owner of the Schoenhofen Brewing Company, and purchased in 1911 by Chicago's Wrigley family. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the house was built in 1896 by Richard Schmidt and, possibly, Hugh M.G. Garden, two architects later prominent in the prairie school movement. A four-story home with three-story coach house, both built on a grand scale and in a late-Italian Renaissance style, the Theuer-Wrigley House is one of Chicago's most stunning homes.\nThe house itself covers over 15,000 square feet, including eight bedrooms, a conservatory and a ballroom. A three-story coach house has additional bedrooms.  In 1984 the house had sat empty for several decades and a plan was made to make it the official residence of the mayor of Chicago, though the plan was never realized.",

The core of the estate was a farmstead Webster purchased from Nathaniel Thomas in 1832.  Webster was known for his interest in agricultural science, and he made his farm one of the most productive in the area.  Webster's house burned down in 1878, but a new house was built on its foundations. The property includes a number of landscape features designed by Webster, as well as the site where his small law office building stood during his lifetime.  (The building, now a National Historic Landmark, was moved in 1966 to the property of the Isaac Winslow House, also a museum property.)A summer camp was run on the site, with the main house serving as its administrative office, from the 1950s until its closing in the summer of 1998.  The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. It is currently owned by the town of Marshfield and is open for tours during the summer.",

It was listed on the National Register as a typical example of the types of Queen Anne summer homes that middle and upper-class Minneapolis residents owned on Lake Minnetonka during the end of the 19th century.  An identical house owned by Samuel A.

In an effort to stabilize the foundation and rebuild the wraparound porch while preserving the character of the house, the owners undertook a major restoration project.  The project, conducted by Wes Foss, the husband of Thompson's great-great-granddaughter Debbie, was featured on a three-part episode of Hometime on PBS and won an award from the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota in 2005.The house is currently one of the oldest extant summer houses on Lake Minnetonka and is in excellent condition.

It was built as a school in 1895 and was converted to a courthouse in 1927.  Architect J.F. Reynolds of Sioux City, Iowa designed the conversion.The 1927 conversion created permanent courthouse space adequate for the court, which was desirable to settle dispute within the county about the county seat's proper location.  Pender, established in 1884, has always been the county seat of Thurston County, established in 1889, but during the early 1900s the town of Walthill struggled to obtain the seat instead.  The First Thurston County Courthouse (also NRHP-listed) had inadequate space and the county leased additional space from the nearby Palace Hotel.  As part of promoting a county seat change, Walthill proponents sued the county commissioners to dispute the leasing arrangement in a case that won in a lower court and then went up to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which upheld the leasing arrangement and reversed the lower court decision.  Walthill also pursued a petition drive which failed after Pender advocates established that there was fraud in obtaining signatures.  The controversy included other charges back and forth, and went on during 1909 and 1910.:\u200a6\u20137\u200aIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1990.",

There is also the home of George Haynes, a Haynes family slave.\nTipton led the opposition to the State of Franklin, an unsuccessful attempt by the Tennessee Valley residents to form a state in the mid-1780s.  In late February 1788, the so-called \"Battle of Franklin\" took place when a militia led by John Sevier, who had been elected governor of the proposed state, surrounded the Tipton farm and demanded the return of several slaves Tipton had confiscated from Sevier upon court order from the State of North Carolina. When Tipton refused, gunfire was exchanged, followed by a two-day standoff.  Sevier's forces were finally scattered by the Sullivan County militia.  The Franklin movement largely collapsed following this engagement.Following Tipton's death in 1813, the farm passed to his son, John Tipton, Jr. After John Tipton, Jr. died in 1831, his heirs sold the property to a local land speculator, David Haynes, in 1837.  In 1839, Haynes gave the farm to his son, Landon Carter Haynes, as a wedding present.  This younger Haynes enlarged the house and added weatherboarding. A Confederate senator during the Civil War, Landon Carter Haynes faced death threats from East Tennessee Unionists and was forced to flee the region in 1865.  He sold the farm to his brother-in-law, Jonesborough publisher Lawson Gifford.  In 1945, Gifford's grandson, David Simmerly, sold the farm to the Tennessee Historical Commission, though he continued living there until his death.It is one of 18 State Historic Sites and is operated by the Tipton-Haynes Association under an agreement with the Tennessee Historical Commission.

It has also been known as West Baltimore General Hospital, Lutheran Hospital of Maryland and is currently being redeveloped by Coppin Heights Community Development Corporation to be a Center for Healthcare & Healthy Living.\n\nBuilt in 1875, the Hebrew Orphan Asylum in Baltimore, Maryland replaced the old Calverton Mansion (built in 1815) when a fire destroyed the mansion in 1874. The Hebrew Orphan Asylum, which started in 1872 in the Calverton Mansion depended on donations from people within the Baltimore Jewish community, including the wealthy German Jewish community that had settled within the city. The history of the asylum follows the history of the Jewish community in Baltimore, which increased rapidly with immigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. The building transitioned to serve as the West Baltimore General Hospital from 1923 through 1950 and finally the Lutheran Hospital of Maryland from 1950 to 1989. While associated structures associated with the Hebrew Orphan Asylum, the West Baltimore General Hospital, and the Lutheran Hospital of Maryland were demolished in 2009, the original four-story brick Romanesque structure still stands.\n\nThe building is a south-facing Victorian Romanesque red brick structure.  Its central block is four stories high and five bays wide, with a large porch and projecting turrets at each corner.  The central block is flanked by three-story wings, each four bays wide, on the west and east.  The Hebrew Orphan Asylum was designed by Lupus & Roby, the partnership of Edward Lupus (1834\u20131877) and Henry Albert Roby (1844\u20131905), and constructed by Edward Brady (1830\u20131900).The history of the development at the site of the current building began in 1815 with the construction of \"Calverton,\" the country home of Baltimore banker Dennis Smith. This building was re-purposed and expanded for use as the Baltimore City and County Almshouse from 1820 through 1866. Calverton featured a central mansion for caretakers, large wings on either side for male and female dormitories and a \"lunatic\" hospital. The Hebrew Orphan Asylum was established in 1872 and operated in the Calverton mansion until displaced by a fire in 1874. After some deliberation, the leaders of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum decided to rebuild at the same location following a design by architects Lupus & Roby.\nThe Hebrew Orphan Asylum moved to a new facility in 1923 and the building transitioned to serve as the West Baltimore General Hospital from 1923 through 1950. The facility then became the Lutheran Hospital of Maryland and remained in use from 1950 to 1989. The history of the building as a hospital included the addition of several related structures to the campus only one of which, a 1945 maternity ward, remaining extant. This building, designed by Henry Powell Hopkins and built by the John K. Ruff Company, now operates as the Tuerk House, a residential drug and alcohol rehab facility. The original Hebrew Orphan Asylum building has been vacant since 1989 and has been owned by Coppin State University since 2003.Baltimore Heritage, a nonprofit historic preservation advocacy organization, nominated the Hebrew Orphan Asylum to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 in partnership with Coppin Heights Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit CDC originally formed by Coppin State University.The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 2010. The listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of November 5, 2010.",

Books were originally kept in the Village Hall, but in 1917 a small building was moved to a location on Rockford Road, now known as 42nd Avenue North, west of the Great Northern Railway (now BNSF Railway) tracks.  This building proved inadequate, so a new library building was built on the same location and opened on January 4, 1926.  The cost of construction, about $8,000 to $9,000, was funded with donations from local citizens and the library club.  The Hennepin County Library system took over the library in 1922, but the library club still owned the building and grounds.Eventually, the Hennepin County Library system built a larger, regional library in Crystal about a mile west of the Robbinsdale library. The new Rockford Road Library opened in 1973, so the old Robbinsdale library was closed in 1975.  At the time of its closure, the library had a collection of about 17,000 volumes and an annual circulation of over 102,000.  City Councilman Verne Baker led efforts to list the building on the National Register of Historic Places.

The home was built in the Norman Romanesque Revival style which gained popularity in the mid 19th century.  The architect was William Tinsley and \"Oakwood\" was his only Romanesque design.  Isaac Graveson is reported as the manufacturer and Francis Pedretti as the interior designer.  By the end of construction in 1866 the cost to build the home was $500,000.  Tinsley decided to unite limestone and sandstone in the construction of \"Oakwood\" which was successful and influenced the use of those materials in future residences in Cincinnati.  The initials \"HP\" for Henry Probasco and \"JA\" for Julia Amanda are located on the gable along with the date \"1860.\"  Tinsley also put his monogrammed initials \"T\" over a \"W.\"  The house is 170 ft. long and 70 ft. wide, fronting southwardly.",

It is \"significant for its illustration of evolving architectural forms and influences from ca. 1790 into the twentieth century, as altered from an essentially vernacular hall-and-parlor house to a residence with Early Classical revival and Greek revival influences. Extant features from the original house and the ca. 1800, ca. 1830, ca. 1850, and later alterations show how succeeding owners adapted the house to their changing needs and circumstances. It is also significant as a basically intact nineteenth and early twentieth century farm complex.\"The earliest part of the main house was built around 1790 by a man named Pleasant Tisdale, who had taken title to the surrounding 340 acres (140 ha) in 1787. Around 1850, John Ouldfield Heriot substantially expanded the house to its present appearance. In 1920, the property was acquired by Francis Marion Moise (1893\u20131968) who adapted it to the needs of his family.In 1986 Air Force Lt. Col. Eric McConnell and his wife Jeannie McConnell acquired the property from the Moise family, but waited for two years before they started renovations to the house so they could make it their home. In July 1989 they were able to move in with their two children, but within two months Hurricane Hugo caused extensive damage, which necessitated repairs. Later in December 1991 approximately $37,000 (~$71,223 in 2022) worth of damage was done to the interior furnishings by vandals.On December 21, 1989, the Heriot-Moise House was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The designation includes the surrounding property and several outbuildings including a log slave house which dates to the 1790s and a small house which dates to the early 19th century.",

Services also were held in the buiLding whenever a circuit rider or evangelist traveled through the neighborhood.

The fort site is open to the public.\nThe William Johnson House was the home of William Johnson, a 19th-century free African American barber and resident of Natchez whose diary has been published.\nMelrose was the estate of John T. McMurran, a lawyer, state senator, and planter who lived in Natchez from 1830 until the Civil War.\nForks of the Road marks what was the second-busiest slave trading market in the Deep South between 1832 and 1863. This unit of the park opened in an official ceremony on June 18, 2021.Both Melrose and the William Johnson House contain furnishings related to life in antebellum Natchez and other exhibits.  The collection at Melrose's two-story Greek Revival mansion and its slave quarters include painted floor cloths, mahogany, a punkah, a set of Rococo Revival parlor furniture, a set of Gothic Revival dining room chairs, and bookcases with books dating to the 18th century.  These were collected from Natchez families, including the McMurran family.  The collection in the Johnson house includes furnishings from his life and family.  Archaeological objects found in the park are also on display.",

It was built in 1768 by Hill, one of the earliest settlers of the region. His family has lived there ever since. Nathaniel Hill was born in 1705, emigrated from Ireland in about 1725, and died May 5, 1780. At the time of his death, he was the owner and possessor of some 700 acres (2.8 km2) of land. Hill originally built a home in the town of Crawford, New York, which he only lived in for two years. He left that home to his son James, who made Applejack Brandy there. The first public record of Hill is his enlistment in Captain Bayard's militia in 1738.\nThe Brick House was passed down for seven generations, from Nathaniel Hill, to Captain Peter Hill (July 22, 1752 \u2013 October 14, 1795), to Nathaniel Peter Hill (Feb. 14, 1781 \u2013 May 2, 1841), to Augustus Hill (May 4, 1838 \u2013 November 2, 1903) to Charles Borland Hill (June 5, 1868 \u2013 1959), to C.B. Hill, Jr. (Nov. 30, 1901\u2013?), to C.B. Hill III (May 26, 1931\u2013?). But it was originally made as a retirement house for Nathaniel Hill.\nThe house was featured in Good Housekeeping magazine, the December 1968 edition.\nThe house was donated by C.B. Hill, Jr. on Dec. 26, 1975, to the County of Orange, it was entered on the National Register of Historic Places on Jan. 5, 1978, and opened as a museum June 22, 1978.\nMuch of the original design and appointments (including some Chippendale furniture pieces) remain, though improvements have been made. In the 1830s the Hills added a large rear wing to the house and renovated part of the interior; almost a century later indoor plumbing was added.The Hills have cooperated with the county in allowing the land around the house to be used as a park, and the Orange County Farmers' Museum. It and their house are open 10 a.m. \u2013 4:30 p.m. on weekends between mid-May and early October (actual dates vary each year). Admission is $3 for adults and $2 for children.",

Located on Main Street near the Hamilton County Courthouse, this 1882 building has been named a historic site.Nathaniel Ropes founded a company to manufacture lard, candles, and other oil-based products in the first half of the nineteenth century.  In 1844, he bought a piece of property in what is now the 900 block of Main Street in downtown Cincinnati, and upon this lot he erected a frame building.  This structure stood for twenty-seven years; it was replaced by a larger structure in 1871, and this building in turn was removed for the construction of the present edifice.  Ropes appears to have arranged for the building's construction for investment purposes; it was erected only after he had bought 11 feet (3.4 m) of land on the southern edge of his original lot, and none of the buildings at the site appear ever to have housed Ropes' business.The Ropes Building is a brick structure that features elements of sandstone and iron in its construction.  Many ornate details characterize its facade, such as variations in the materials used and in the shapes of elements of all types, which combine to form a fine example of the Queen Anne style of architecture.  Because of its well-preserved historic architecture, which also aids in distinguishing a group of adjacent commercial buildings, the Nathaniel Ropes Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.",

Union Station is a station stop for most Amtrak Northeast Regional trains and all CTrail Shore Line East commuter rail trains, making it the primary railroad station in southeastern Connecticut. It serves as the centerpiece of the Regional Intermodal Transit Center, with connections to local and intercity buses as well as ferries to Long Island and Fishers Island, New York, and Block Island, Rhode Island. The station has one side platform and one island platform serving the two-track Northeast Corridor; the latter platform also serves a siding track that connects to the New England Central Railroad mainline.\nRail service to New London began with the New London, Willimantic, and Palmer Railroad in 1848 and the New Haven and New London Railroad in 1852. The original stations were each replaced in the 1860s; after several consolidations, they were served by the Central Vermont Railway (CV) and New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (New Haven) by the 1870s. After one of the stations burned in 1885, a new three-story brick union station was erected in 1887. It was the last and largest railroad station designed by famed architect H. H. Richardson, and his best according to biographer Henry-Russell Hitchcock.Passenger service declined in the 20th century; all CV passenger service to New London ended in 1949. The New London Redevelopment Agency began planning in 1961 to demolish the station as part of urban renewal. Amtrak took over passenger service in May 1971; Union Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places the next month following a local effort. After several years of controversy over whether to demolish or preserve the structure, it was purchased by architect George M. Notter in 1975. Notter's firm renovated the station for combined use by Amtrak and commercial tenants; it was the first station to be restored for Amtrak's use, and one of the earliest cases of adaptive reuse of an industrial-age building in New England.\nShore Line East commuter service joined Amtrak intercity service at the station in 1996. High-level platforms were added in 2001 to serve the new Acela Express service. A second renovation in 2002\u201303 restored the exterior and returned the waiting room to its original configuration. The planned National Coast Guard Museum, which will be located across the tracks from the station, will include a long-planned footbridge over the tracks.\n\n",

        "short_description": "building in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States",
        "long_description": "North East Neighborhood House (NENH) is a building in the Northeast neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The building housed a social services organization established in 1915 by Plymouth Church, a Minneapolis congregational church.  The roots of the organization go back to Immanuel Sunday School, established in 1881 near Second Street Northeast and Broadway Street Northeast.  The school later built a new building, Drummond Hall, near Second Street Northeast and 15th Avenue Northeast.  The church expanded its programs to include various social services and clubs for neighborhood residents who had immigrated to Northeast Minneapolis from France, Germany, and Scandinavia.  The demographics of the area had changed by the 1910s, though, and most of the newcomers were from eastern Europe.  These newcomers still needed social services, but since most of them were Catholic, they were unwilling to accept Protestant religious education.  The attendance dropped, forcing Drummond Hall to close in 1913.Plymouth Church still wanted to provide social services in northeast Minneapolis, so they commissioned a study to determine what they could provide for social services.  The key finding of the study was that the neighborhood needed a sense of unity, since immigrants from various ethnic groups had differences with each other.  The study found that they could acquaint new immigrants with American cultural norms and provide education, health care, and recreation.  The church established a settlement house and hired Robbins Gilman, who had recently been fired from University Settlement House because of his support for the Industrial Workers of the World.  The house opened in the Drummond Hall building, but later moved to a new, larger building a few blocks north.Robbins Gilman was aided by his wife, Catheryne, who was also a reformer. She influenced some of the NENH's programs but was more active in other organizations. When the NENH began operations on January 20, 1915, it was one of four settlement houses in the city. It offered classes in sewing, cooking, carpentry, and dancing. It also provided a supervised setting for the children of the neighborhood to socialize.Robbins Gilman hired one supervisor for boys and one for girls. This allowed him to focus on his grander ideas for the facility. A program to help women find work in conjunction with a day nursery was created. Within the first three years the NENH helped over 7,000 women find work. Gilman also began a dental clinic for children. As services expanded, so did the NENH's popularity.In 1918 construction of a new facility in the neo-Georgian style designed by Kenyon and Main was begun. By August of the next year NENH staff had moved into the new building. During the 1920s the facility offered more services and continued to expand. Two new wings, which included a gymnasium and a dormitory, were completed in 1927. When the Great Depression hit, the NENH became a focal point for aid programs in the neighborhood.In 1948 Gilman retired from his work at the NENH. He was succeeded by Lester Shaeffer and subsequently Joe Holewa, a native of the Northeast neighborhood. The latter half of the 20th century brought great changes to the NENH and other settlement houses. Government and well-funded private groups began dominating social services. The people who had grown up with the NENH moved out of the neighborhood; new arrivals were unfamiliar with its mission.  The house continued in operation until the early 1960s, when it merged with the Margaret Barry House, another settlement house.  The combined organization was renamed East Side Neighborhood Services.  East Side Neighborhood Services moved out of the Georgian Revival building in 2001 and into a new, modern building.  The 1919 building was renovated and now serves as apartments.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.",
